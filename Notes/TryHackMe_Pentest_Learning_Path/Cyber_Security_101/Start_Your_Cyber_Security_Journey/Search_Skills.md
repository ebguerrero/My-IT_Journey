# 🔍 Search Skills

Learn to efficiently search the Internet and use specialized search engines and technical documentation.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
This room will teach you to:

- Evaluate information sources
- Use search engines efficiently
- Explore specialized search engines
- Read technical documentation
- Make use of social media
- Check news outlets

---

## 🧠 Task 1 – Introduction
- Information overload makes effective searching a critical skill.
- You must learn to find **relevant, credible, and authoritative sources** instead of relying only on the first few results.

---

## 🪣 Task 2 – Evaluation of Search Results
When evaluating information, check for:

1. **Source** – Is the author/organization reputable and authoritative?
2. **Evidence & Reasoning** – Are claims backed by credible data?
3. **Objectivity & Bias** – Is information presented fairly, without agenda?
4. **Corroboration & Consistency** – Do multiple independent sources agree?

**Key Terms:**
- **Snake oil** → A product or method considered fraudulent.
- `ss` → Replaces `netstat` on Linux systems.

---

## 🌐 Task 3 – Search Engines
Use **Google search operators** to refine results:

| Operator | Example | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `"exact phrase"` | `"passive reconnaissance"` | Find exact matches |
| `site:` | `site:tryhackme.com success stories` | Search only within a domain |
| `-` | `pyramids -tourism` | Exclude keywords |
| `filetype:` | `filetype:pdf cyber security` | Search for specific file types |

**Examples:**
- `filetype:pdf cyber warfare report`
- `filetype:ppt cyber security`

## 🕵️ Task 4 – Specialized Search Engines

### 🔎 Shodan
- Search Internet-connected devices, servers, IoT, ICS systems.
- Example: `apache 2.4.1` shows servers running that version.

### 🌐 Censys
- Focuses on hosts, websites, and certificates.
- Used for asset discovery and auditing open ports.

### 🦠 VirusTotal
- Scans files or URLs against 67+ antivirus engines.
- Use for malware analysis and file reputation checks.

---

## 🔐 Task 5 – Vulnerabilities and Exploits

### CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures)
- Standardized identifier for vulnerabilities.  
- Example: `CVE-2014-0160` (Heartbleed).

### Exploit Database
- Repository of exploit code and PoCs.
- Example: Search for Heartbleed exploits to test systems.

### GitHub
- Contains PoC code and scripts for CVEs.
- Example: `CVE-2014-0160` search lists many exploits and test tools.

---

## 📚 Task 6 – Technical Documentation

### Linux Man Pages
- Use `man` command to view documentation.
- Example: `man ip` → shows syntax and options.

### Product Documentation
- Always check official vendor docs.
- Example: `ipconfig` documentation on Microsoft Learn.

**Commands:**
- `cat` = concatenate
- `netstat -b` = shows executable linked to connections

---

## 👥 Task 7 – Social Media
- Use platforms like **LinkedIn** to learn about employees or companies.
- Ensure people you protect do not overshare sensitive information.
- Follow cybersecurity experts, trends, and news outlets to stay informed.

---

## ✅ Task 8 – Conclusion
This room introduced key search skills and resources that will help you:

- Perform passive reconnaissance legally
- Validate and cross-check information
- Use specialized tools (Shodan, VirusTotal)
- Access documentation and technical references efficiently
