---

## 🧰 Task 3 — Features of Burp Community
---

Although **Burp Suite Community** offers a more limited feature set compared to the **Professional** edition, it still provides an impressive array of tools that are **highly valuable for web application testing**.

Below are some of the **key features** available in Burp Suite Community, along with deeper explanations of their purpose and real-world relevance.

---

### 🕸️ Proxy

The **Burp Proxy** is the most renowned and foundational aspect of Burp Suite.

It enables:
- 🔁 Interception of requests sent from the browser to the target server
- ✏️ Modification of requests before they reach the server
- 👀 Inspection of responses before they are rendered by the browser

By positioning itself **between the browser and the web application**, the proxy allows testers to observe *exactly* how data is transmitted and manipulated during normal application use.
Key point...By positioning itself between the browser and the web application server, Burp Proxy allows testers to intercept and manipulate application-layer traffic.

📌 **Why this matters:**  
Nearly all web application vulnerabilities stem from how user-supplied input is handled. The Proxy provides full visibility and control over that interaction.

---

### 🔁 Repeater

**Repeater** is another well-known and heavily used Burp feature.

It allows testers to:
- Capture a single HTTP request
- Modify parameters, headers, or payloads
- Re-send the same request multiple times manually

This is particularly useful when:
- Testing input validation
- Crafting payloads through trial and error
- Exploring vulnerabilities such as **SQL injection (SQLi)** or logic flaws
- Testing how an endpoint behaves under slightly altered inputs

📌 **Why this matters:**  
Repeater turns one captured request into a controlled testing environment, letting you isolate and understand server behavior without automation noise.

---

### 🎯 Intruder

Despite rate limitations in **Burp Suite Community**, **Intruder** allows testers to **spray endpoints with crafted requests**. (Spraying endpoints - Sending the same type of HTTP request to a single URL (endpoint) many times, with systematic changes to parts of the request.)

It is commonly used for:
- 🔐 Brute-forcing login forms
- 🧪 Fuzzing parameters (Fuzzing means: Sending unexpected, malformed, or varied input to see how the server reacts. A parameter is any user-controlled input:username= password= id= role= price= token=)
- 🔁 Testing multiple payloads against the same endpoint

While Community Edition restricts speed, the underlying functionality still demonstrates how automated attacks are structured.

📌 **Why this matters:**  
Intruder introduces the concept of **payload-driven attacks**, which is central to modern web exploitation techniques.

---

### 🔓 Decoder

**Decoder** provides a built-in utility for **data transformation**.

It can:
- Decode captured information (e.g., Base64, URL encoding)
- Encode payloads before sending them to a target
- Convert data between multiple representations

Although external tools exist for these tasks, Decoder allows transformations to occur **directly inside Burp**, keeping your workflow efficient.

📌 **Why this matters:**  
Many vulnerabilities involve encoded data. Being able to quickly decode and re-encode values is essential for understanding and manipulating application behavior.

---

### 🧮 Comparer

As the name suggests, **Comparer** allows comparison of two pieces of data at either:
- 📝 Word level
- 🧬 Byte level

This is useful when:
- Comparing two similar HTTP responses
- Identifying subtle differences in server behavior
- Verifying whether changes in input cause meaningful output differences


## 🧮 Comparer — What “Word” vs “Byte” Actually Means

### 🔍 Word-Level Comparison (Human-Readable Differences)

**Word comparison** breaks responses into meaningful text segments (words/strings) and highlights differences in a way that is **easy for humans to read**.

#### Example Scenario

You send two similar requests:

* Request A → `id=123`
* Request B → `id=124`

Both responses look almost identical in the browser.

Comparer (Word mode) might highlight:

```diff
Welcome back, user!
Your account balance is $100
```

vs

```diff
Welcome back, user!
Your account balance is $0
```

📌 **Why this matters:**
Word comparison helps you spot **logical differences**, such as:

* Authorization issues
* Data leakage
* Business logic flaws
  …that aren’t obvious at a glance.

---

### 🧬 Byte-Level Comparison (Machine-Precision Differences)

**Byte comparison** compares raw binary data, byte by byte.

This is useful when:

* Responses look identical visually
* Compression or encoding is involved
* Timing or padding differences exist

#### Example Scenario

Two responses both return `200 OK` and look the same in the browser, but:

* One is **5 bytes longer**
* One includes a hidden flag or token
* One contains extra padding

Byte comparison reveals:

```text
Byte offset 342 differs
```

📌 **Why this matters:**
Tiny byte-level differences can indicate:

* Different server code paths
* Auth checks passing vs failing
* Hidden data exposure

🧠 **Pentester insight:**
Comparer often confirms suspicions raised by Intruder or Repeater.


📌 **Why this matters:**  
Small response differences often indicate security weaknesses. Comparer helps surface those differences quickly.

---

### 🎲 Sequencer

**Sequencer** is typically used to assess the **randomness of tokens**, such as:
- Session cookies
- CSRF tokens
- Other supposedly random values

If the algorithm generating these values lacks sufficient randomness, it can expose the application to **session prediction or hijacking attacks**.

📌 **Why this matters:**  
Weak randomness can undermine authentication and session security entirely.

## 🎲 Sequencer — What Randomness Testing Looks Like in Practice

### 🔐 What Sequencer Is Actually Testing

Sequencer analyzes whether values that *should* be random are:

* Predictable
* Repeating
* Statistically weak

It does this by:

1. Capturing **many samples**
2. Running statistical tests
3. Measuring entropy (randomness)

---

### 🧪 Example: Session Cookie Analysis

Imagine the application issues session cookies like:

```
SESSIONID=abc123
SESSIONID=abc124
SESSIONID=abc125
```

Sequencer collects hundreds of these and discovers:

* Values increment sequentially
* Characters repeat in patterns
* Entropy is low

📌 **Why this matters:**
An attacker could:

* Predict future session IDs
* Hijack active sessions
* Bypass authentication entirely

---

### 🧪 Example: CSRF Token Analysis

A CSRF token should be:

* Unique per request
* Unpredictable
* High entropy

Sequencer may reveal:

* Tokens are time-based
* Tokens reuse patterns
* Tokens repeat after restart

📌 **Why this matters:**
Weak CSRF tokens make it possible to:

* Forge requests
* Perform unauthorized actions as victims

---

## 🧠 Big Picture Pentester Insight

| Tool      | What It Answers                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Comparer  | “Are these responses *really* the same?” |
| Sequencer | “Can this value be predicted?”           |

Both tools:

* Are **confirmation tools**
* Support findings from other Burp features
* Expose issues that are **invisible in the browser**

---

## 🔒 Final Takeaway (Mental Anchor)

* **Comparer** reveals *hidden differences*
* **Sequencer** reveals *hidden patterns*

If you ever find yourself thinking:

> “These responses feel slightly different…”
> or
> “This token feels too clean…”

These are the tools you reach for.

---

### 🧩 Extensions and the BApp Store

Beyond built-in features, Burp Suite’s **Java-based architecture** supports extensibility.

Extensions can be written in:
- ☕ Java
- 🐍 Python (via Jython)
- 💎 Ruby (via JRuby)

The **Burp Suite Extender** module allows quick loading of extensions, while the **BApp Store** provides access to community-developed modules.

📌 Even though some extensions require a professional license, **many are still available for Burp Community**.

For example:
- **Logger++** enhances Burp’s built-in logging capabilities, making traffic analysis easier.

📌 **Why this matters:**  
Extensions allow Burp to evolve beyond its default capabilities, adapting to different testing styles and workflows.

- ✅ **Event log**

---

## 🧭 Task 6 — Navigation

---

In **Burp Suite**, default navigation is primarily handled through the **top menu bar**, which allows you to switch between modules and access various sub-tabs within each module.

When a module is selected, its **sub-tabs** appear in a secondary menu bar directly beneath the main navigation bar.

---

### 🧩 1. Module Selection

The **top row of the menu bar** displays the available modules in Burp Suite.

Examples include:
- Dashboard
- Target
- Proxy
- Intruder
- Repeater
- Sequencer
- Decoder
- Comparer
- Extensions

Clicking on a module switches the main workspace to that tool.

📌 **Why this matters:**  
Each module represents a distinct phase or capability in the web application testing workflow.

---

### 🗂️ 2. Sub-Tabs

Each selected module contains **multiple sub-tabs**, accessible via the secondary menu bar directly below the main menu.

📌 **Why this matters:**  
Burp has a large number of configurable options. The search and category features prevent configuration from becoming overwhelming.

---

### 🧩 Settings Categories

Settings are grouped into logical categories, such as:
- Proxy
- Sessions
- Scope
- Logging
- Network
- User interface
- Suite
- Extensions

For example:
- The **Proxy** module includes a **Proxy settings** button that opens the settings window directly to Proxy-related options
- Session handling rules are found under the **Sessions** category

📌 **Why this matters:**  
Understanding where settings live makes troubleshooting and configuration significantly faster.

---

### 🔎 Searching Settings

The **search feature** allows you to quickly locate settings by keyword.

This is especially useful when:
- You know *what* you want to change

- ✅ **Yes**


---

## 🧩 Task 8 — Introduction to the Burp Proxy

---

The **Burp Proxy** is a fundamental and crucial tool within Burp Suite. It enables the capture, inspection, and manipulation of **requests and responses** between a user (client) and a target web server.

All intercepted traffic can be:
- Viewed
- Modified
- Forwarded
- Dropped
- Sent to other Burp tools for further analysis

This capability allows Burp Proxy to act as a **man-in-the-middle**, giving testers deep visibility into web application behavior.

---

## 🔑 Key Points to Understand About the Burp Proxy

---

### 🔁 Intercepting Requests

When **Intercept** is enabled, Burp Proxy:
- Actively **pauses HTTP(S) requests**
- Prevents them from reaching the target server
- Displays them in the **Intercept** tab for inspection

From here, you can:
- Forward the request unchanged
- Modify headers, parameters, or payloads
- Drop the request entirely
- Send the request to other tools (e.g., Repeater or Intruder)

📌 **Important Reinforcement:**  
Intercepting requests means Burp is holding traffic *before it reaches the server*. If Intercept is ON and a request is not forwarded, the page will not load.

---

### 🎛️ Taking Control of Traffic

By intercepting requests, you gain **complete control** over how data is sent to the application.

This enables testing for:
- Input validation weaknesses
- Authorization flaws
- Parameter manipulation
- Trust in client-side controls

📌 **Key Concept:**  
Client-side restrictions (UI, JavaScript, hidden fields) do **not** provide security. Burp Proxy allows you to test how the **server** actually responds.

---

### 📜 Capturing and Logging Requests

Burp Proxy captures **all requests and responses** that pass through it by default.

These are logged in:
- **HTTP history**
- **WebSockets history**

📌 **Why this matters:**  
Even when Intercept is OFF, Burp still passively records traffic. HTTP history becomes the primary reference point for reviewing application behavior.

---

### 🔌 WebSocket Support

Burp Proxy also supports **WebSocket traffic**, which is used by applications that rely on:
- Real-time communication
- Live updates
- Two-way persistent connections

WebSocket messages can be:
- Logged
- Intercepted (if configured)
- Sent to other Burp tools

📌 **Note:**  
WebSockets differ from traditional HTTP because they maintain an open connection rather than using a request/response model.

---

### 🧭 Navigating Proxy Logs

Captured requests and responses can be:
- Viewed directly in HTTP history
- Filtered for noise reduction
- Selected and sent to:
  - Repeater
  - Intruder
  - Comparer
  - Decoder

📌 **Workflow Reinforcement:**  
Most analysis begins in HTTP history, not the Intercept tab. Intercept is used **selectively**, not continuously.

---

## ⚙️ Proxy Settings Overview

The Proxy module includes extensive configuration options that control how Burp handles traffic.

These settings allow you to:
- Customize interception behavior
- Define request and response handling rules
- Control TLS behavior
- Modify content automatically
- Configure WebSocket interception

Access Proxy-specific settings via:
- **Proxy → Proxy settings**

---

### 🧪 Response Interception (Default Behavior)

By default:
- Burp intercepts **requests**
- Burp does **not intercept responses** unless explicitly configured

Response interception can be enabled via **response interception rules**, which allow conditions such as:
- Intercepting responses with specific status codes
- Intercepting responses based on content type
- Intercepting responses only for in-scope targets

📌 **Why this matters:**  
Response interception is powerful but noisy. It is typically enabled only when actively testing server responses.

---

### 🔄 Match and Replace

The **Match and Replace** feature allows Burp to automatically modify:
- Incoming requests
- Outgoing requests
- Incoming responses

This can be used to:
- Rewrite headers
- Modify parameters
- Change content values using regex

📌 **Use Case Example:**  
Automatically rewrite headers or tokens without manual editing of each request.

---

## 🧠 Proxy Takeaway

The Burp Proxy is the **central traffic control point** in Burp Suite.

Understanding how and when to:
- Enable interception
- Review HTTP history
- Configure Proxy settings
- Manage TLS and WebSocket behavior

…is essential before moving into more advanced testing techniques.

Take time to explore Proxy options and settings gradually. Mastery of the Proxy lays the foundation for effective use of all other Burp tools.

- ✅ **No answer needed**

---

## 🦊 Task 9 — Connecting through the Proxy (FoxyProxy)

---

To use the **Burp Suite Proxy**, we must configure our local browser to route traffic **through Burp**. In this task, we accomplish this using the **FoxyProxy** browser extension for Firefox.

This setup allows Burp to sit between the browser and the target server, enabling interception, inspection, and modification of HTTP requests.

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step: Configuring FoxyProxy for Burp

---

### 1️⃣ Install FoxyProxy

Install the **FoxyProxy Basic** extension for Firefox.

📌 **Note:**  
FoxyProxy is pre-installed on the TryHackMe AttackBox, but must be installed manually on a personal system.

---

### 2️⃣ Open FoxyProxy Options

Once installed:
- Click the **FoxyProxy icon** in the top-right of Firefox
- Select **Options**

This opens the FoxyProxy configuration page.

---

### 3️⃣ Create a New Proxy Configuration

Click **Add** and enter the following values:

| Field | Value |
|-----|------|
| **Title** | Burp |
| **Proxy Type** | HTTP |
| **Proxy IP address / DNS name** | `127.0.0.1` |
| **Port** | `8080` |

📌 **Explanation:**  
- `127.0.0.1` refers to the **local machine (loopback interface)**
- Port `8080` is the default port where Burp Proxy listens
- This tells Firefox to send traffic to Burp before reaching any website

Click **Save**.

---

### 4️⃣ Activate the Proxy

Click the FoxyProxy icon again and select the **Burp** proxy configuration.

📌 Once enabled, **all Firefox traffic** will be routed through Burp Suite.

---

### 5️⃣ Enable Intercept in Burp Suite

In Burp Suite:
- Navigate to **Proxy → Intercept**
- Ensure **Intercept is ON**

This tells Burp to pause requests before forwarding them to the target server.

---

### 6️⃣ Test the Proxy Connection

Open Firefox and attempt to visit the target machine:

```

[http://10.66.134.3/](http://10.66.134.3/)

```

Expected behavior:
- The browser may pause or display an error
- Burp Proxy populates with intercepted HTTP requests

📌 **Important Clarification (Modern Burp Behavior):**  
In newer versions of Burp Suite, if the target server is **not listening on the requested port** (e.g., port 80), Burp may display its own error page:

```

Failed to connect to 10.66.134.3:80

```

This page is generated by **Burp**, not the browser.

This still confirms that:
- Firefox traffic is routed through Burp
- Burp is acting as the proxy
- Interception is working correctly

---

### 7️⃣ Verifying Interception (Recommended Sanity Check)

To cleanly verify interception, try visiting a known working HTTP site:

```

[http://example.com](http://example.com)

```

With **Intercept ON**:
- The browser pauses
- Burp displays the intercepted request
- Clicking **Forward** allows the page to load

This confirms full proxy functionality regardless of the target VM’s state.

## ⚠️ Things to Remember

- When Intercept is ON, pages will not load until requests are forwarded
- Browsers generate background traffic (e.g., Firefox connectivity checks)
- Not all intercepted requests are relevant — identify requests by **Host** header
- Leaving Intercept ON unintentionally can make browsing appear “broken”

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

FoxyProxy allows controlled routing of browser traffic through Burp Suite without modifying system-wide proxy settings.

Successfully completing this task confirms:
- Browser → Burp communication
- Burp Proxy interception
- Proper listener configuration

This setup is foundational for all future Burp-based testing.

## 🗺️ Task 10 — Site Map and Issue Definitions

---

The **Target** tab in Burp Suite provides more than just control over the scope of testing. It also serves as a powerful **enumeration and analysis hub**, allowing us to map applications, review potential vulnerabilities, and precisely define what traffic we care about.

The Target tab consists of three primary sub-tabs:

---

### 🌳 1. Site Map

The **Site map** sub-tab allows us to map out the web application we are targeting in a **tree structure**, built automatically from observed HTTP traffic.

Key characteristics of the Site Map:
- Every page visited while the proxy is active appears in the tree
- Endpoints are grouped by **host and URL path**
- Both visible pages and hidden backend endpoints are captured
- API endpoints accessed via JavaScript are included, even if no UI link exists

📌 **Important Reinforcement:**  
The Site Map reflects **what the application actually exposes over HTTP**, not what is visible in the user interface.

In **Burp Suite Professional**, the Site Map can be populated using automated crawling.  
In **Burp Suite Community**, the Site Map is populated passively as you browse.

This makes the Site Map especially valuable during:
- Initial enumeration
- API discovery
- Identifying hidden or unusual endpoints

---

### 📋 2. Issue Definitions

Although Burp Suite Community does not include active vulnerability scanning, the **Issue definitions** section provides a comprehensive reference of vulnerabilities that Burp’s scanner is capable of identifying.

This section includes:
- Vulnerability names
- Detailed descriptions
- Technical explanations
- References for further reading

📌 **Why this matters:**  
Issue definitions are useful when:
- Writing reports
- Learning vulnerability categories
- Describing findings discovered during manual testing

---

### 🎯 3. Scope Settings

Scope settings allow us to define **which targets Burp should focus on**.

By configuring scope, we can:
- Include specific domains or IP addresses
- Exclude irrelevant traffic
- Reduce background noise
- Focus analysis on the intended application

Proper scoping is essential when working with:
- Browsers that generate background traffic
- Applications that call third-party services
- Larger environments with multiple hosts

---

## 🧪 Challenge — Identifying an Unusual Endpoint

The challenge required browsing the target application and reviewing the Site Map to identify an endpoint that stood out as **unusual**.

### Steps performed:
1. Accessed the target application from the **TryHackMe AttackBox**
2. Browsed every page linked from the homepage
3. Allowed Burp Proxy to capture traffic
4. Reviewed the **Target → Site map** tree
5. Identified a peculiar endpoint that did not match normal application behavior
6. Visited the endpoint directly via the browser or Site Map response view
7. Retrieved the flag

📌 **Key Observation:**  
The unusual endpoint was clearly visible in the Site Map tree structure and stood out due to its naming and purpose compared to standard application paths.

---

### 🚩 Flag

```

THM{NmNlZTllNGE1MWU1ZTQzMzgzNmFiNWVk}

```

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

The Burp Site Map is not just a navigation aid — it is an **enumeration tool**.

By reviewing the Site Map, testers can:
- Discover hidden functionality
- Identify exposed APIs
- Spot abnormal or sensitive endpoints
- Guide targeted testing efforts

This task demonstrates how **passive observation alone** can uncover valuable attack surfaces.

---

### ❓ Questions

- ✅ **Correct Answer Submitted**

## 🌐 Task 11 — The Burp Suite Browser

---

If the previous tasks seemed overly complex, this task is intentionally much simpler.

In addition to configuring an external browser to work with the proxy, **Burp Suite includes a built-in Chromium-based browser** that is **preconfigured to route traffic through the Burp Proxy automatically**.

This removes the need for:
- External proxy configuration
- Browser extensions (e.g., FoxyProxy)
- Manual certificate handling (for basic usage)

---

## 🚀 Launching the Burp Browser

To start the Burp Browser:

1. Navigate to the **Proxy** tab
2. Click the **Open browser** button
3. A Chromium browser window will open
4. Any requests made in this browser will automatically pass through Burp Proxy

📌 **Key Point:**  
This browser is already configured to:
- Use the Burp Proxy
- Route traffic through the active proxy listener
- Appear immediately in HTTP history and Intercept (if enabled)

---

## ⚙️ Burp Browser Settings

There are multiple settings related to the Burp Browser, found under:

```

Settings → Tools → Burp’s browser

```

These settings allow customization of browser behavior, including security and sandboxing options.

---

## 🐧 Linux / AttackBox Consideration

When running Burp Suite on Linux **as the root user** (which is the case in the TryHackMe AttackBox), you may encounter an error preventing the Burp Browser from starting.

This happens because Chromium cannot create a sandbox environment when run as root.

---

## 🛠️ Solutions to the Sandbox Issue

There are two common solutions:

### 1️⃣ Smart Option (More Secure)

- Create a non-root user
- Run Burp Suite under that low-privileged account
- Allows Chromium to run with sandboxing enabled

This is the preferred approach in real environments.

---

### 2️⃣ Easy Option (Used in This Task)

- Go to:
```

Settings → Tools → Burp’s browser

```
- Enable:
```

Allow Burp’s browser to run without a sandbox

```

This disables Chromium sandboxing and allows the browser to launch successfully.

📌 **Security Note:**  
This option is disabled by default for security reasons. Disabling the sandbox can increase risk on a real system. In the controlled training environment of the AttackBox, this is acceptable.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

The Burp Suite Browser provides a **convenient, zero-configuration way** to generate proxy traffic directly inside Burp.

It is ideal for:
- Quick testing
- Learning Burp fundamentals
- Avoiding proxy misconfiguration issues

However, for real-world testing, external browsers with full user context are often preferred.

## 🎯 Task 12 — Scoping and Targeting

---

Scoping is one of the **most important concepts** when using the Burp Proxy.

Without scoping, Burp will capture **every request** made by the browser, including:
- Background browser traffic
- Third-party services
- Update checks
- Analytics and tracking requests

This quickly becomes overwhelming and makes meaningful analysis difficult.

---

## 🧠 What Is Scoping?

Scoping allows us to define **which hosts and applications Burp should focus on**.

By setting a scope:
- Burp can distinguish **in-scope** vs **out-of-scope** traffic
- We reduce noise in HTTP history
- We prevent accidental testing of unintended targets
- We gain clarity when analyzing requests and responses

---

## 📍 Defining Scope in Burp Suite

To define scope for a target:

1. Navigate to the **Target** tab
2. Locate the desired host in the Site Map
3. Right-click the target
4. Select **Add to scope**
5. Confirm the prompt

This tells Burp that the selected host is part of the active testing scope.

---

## ⚠️ UI Clarification (Important)

While the TryHackMe lesson refers to a **“Scope settings” sub-tab** within the Target tab, this **does not exist in the current Burp Suite UI**.

Instead:
- Scope configuration is accessed via the **Settings (⚙️) button** in the top-right
- Scope rules are managed under:
```

Settings → Project → Scope

```

This is a UI evolution in newer Burp versions and does not change the underlying functionality.

---

## 🔍 Viewing and Managing Scope

Within the Scope settings, you can:
- Include specific domains or IP addresses
- Exclude hosts or paths
- Control how Burp treats in-scope vs out-of-scope traffic

This allows precise targeting, especially in environments with multiple hosts.

---

## 🚦 Controlling Interception Based on Scope

Even after defining scope, Burp will still intercept **all traffic by default**.

To restrict interception to only in-scope traffic:

1. Go to:
```

Proxy → Proxy settings

```
2. Enable options to:
- Only intercept **in-scope requests**
- Ignore or automatically forward **out-of-scope traffic**

This dramatically reduces noise in the Intercept tab.

---

## 🧪 Observed Behavior After Scoping

After adding the target to scope and configuring proxy interception rules:

- Out-of-scope traffic no longer cluttered the proxy
- Intercepted requests became far more relevant
- Analysis became faster and more focused

📌 **Key Observation:**  
The difference between scoped and unscoped traffic is immediately noticeable and significantly improves usability.

---

## 🧠 Why Scoping Matters in Practice

Scoping helps:
- Prevent accidental testing of third-party systems
- Focus effort on relevant attack surfaces
- Maintain legal and ethical boundaries
- Scale testing in larger applications

In real engagements, **improper scoping can invalidate an entire assessment**.

---

## ✅ Task Outcome

The target was successfully added to scope, and proxy settings were adjusted to intercept only in-scope traffic.

---

### ❓ Questions

- ✅ **No answer needed**

---

## 🔐 Task 13 — Proxying HTTPS

---

When intercepting **HTTPS traffic**, additional configuration is required. Unlike HTTP, HTTPS uses **TLS encryption**, which prevents Burp from reading or modifying traffic unless the browser explicitly trusts Burp as a Certificate Authority (CA).

If this trust is not established, attempting to visit HTTPS-enabled sites will result in certificate errors.

---

## ⚠️ The HTTPS Problem

When intercepting HTTPS traffic through Burp Proxy, browsers may display warnings such as:

> *“Software is preventing Firefox from safely connecting to this site.”*

This happens because:
- Burp intercepts TLS connections
- Burp dynamically generates certificates for each site
- The browser does **not trust** Burp’s CA by default

As a result, the browser refuses the connection.

---

## 🛠️ Solution: Install the PortSwigger CA Certificate

To allow Burp to intercept HTTPS traffic, we must install and trust the **PortSwigger CA certificate** in the browser.

---

### 1️⃣ Download the CA Certificate

With Burp running:
- Visit:
```

[http://burp](http://burp)

```
- Download the **CA Certificate**
- Save the file locally as:
```

cacert.der

```

📌 This certificate allows Burp to generate trusted certificates for HTTPS sites.

---

### 2️⃣ Open Firefox Certificate Settings

In Firefox:
1. Open **Settings**
2. Navigate to **Privacy & Security**
3. Scroll to **Certificates**
4. Click **View Certificates**

---

### 3️⃣ Import the CA Certificate

Within the Certificate Manager:
1. Select the **Authorities** tab
2. Click **Import**
3. Select the downloaded `cacert.der` file
4. When prompted, check:
 - ✅ **Trust this CA to identify websites**
5. Click **OK**

---

### 4️⃣ Verify HTTPS Interception

After importing the certificate:
- HTTPS-enabled websites load normally
- Burp Proxy can now:
- Intercept HTTPS requests
- Decrypt TLS traffic
- Display requests and responses in plaintext

📌 This confirms successful HTTPS proxying.

---

## 🧠 Why This Works

By trusting the PortSwigger CA:
- The browser accepts certificates generated by Burp
- Burp can decrypt traffic between the browser and server
- Secure communication remains encrypted outside the proxy

This effectively enables **man-in-the-middle inspection** for testing purposes.

---

## ⚠️ Security Reminder

The PortSwigger CA should:
- Only be installed in testing environments
- Never be trusted on production or personal systems long-term

Trusting a malicious CA could compromise all HTTPS traffic.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

HTTPS proxying requires **explicit trust** in Burp’s Certificate Authority.

Without the PortSwigger CA:
- HTTPS traffic cannot be intercepted
- Certificate warnings will block connections

With the CA installed:
- HTTPS traffic flows securely through Burp
- Full inspection and testing is possible

## ⚔️ Task 14 — Example Attack (Client-Side Filter Bypass)

---

This task demonstrates a **real-world web attack scenario** using **Burp Proxy** to bypass client-side input validation and successfully execute a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** payload.

The target application is a simple support form hosted at:

```

[http://10.65.179.118/ticket/](http://10.65.179.118/ticket/)

````

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Identify client-side input filtering
- Bypass the filter using Burp Proxy
- Inject a malicious payload
- Observe successful execution of XSS

---

## 🧠 Background: What’s Happening Here?

The support form implements **client-side validation** to prevent special characters in the *Contact Email* field. While this blocks obvious attacks in the browser, it does **not** protect against attackers who intercept and modify requests before they reach the server.

This is where Burp Proxy shines.

---

## 🧪 Initial Test — Client-Side Protection

Attempting to input the following directly into the form:

```html
<script>alert("Successful XSS")</script>
````

Results in failure due to browser-side filtering.

This confirms:

* Validation is happening **client-side**
* The server is likely not validating input properly

---

## 🔧 Exploitation Steps

### 1️⃣ Enable Burp Proxy Intercept

* Ensure Burp Proxy is running
* Turn **Intercept ON**
* Submit the support form with *legitimate input*, for example:

  * Email: `pentester@example.com`
  * Query: `Test Attack`

---

### 2️⃣ Modify the Intercepted Request

Once the request appears in Burp:

* Locate the `email` parameter
* Replace its value with the XSS payload:

```html
<script>alert("Successful XSS")</script>
```

📌 This bypasses the browser’s client-side validation entirely.

---

### 3️⃣ Forward the Modified Request

* Click **Forward**
* Allow the request to reach the server

---

## ✅ Result

An alert box appears in the browser displaying:

```
Successful XSS
```

This confirms:

* Client-side filtering was bypassed
* The server accepted and rendered the malicious payload
* A reflected XSS vulnerability exists

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

* **Client-side validation is not security**
* Any validation performed only in the browser can be bypassed
* Burp Proxy enables attackers to:

  * Modify requests
  * Inject malicious payloads
  * Exploit server-side weaknesses

This is a textbook example of why **server-side input validation is mandatory**.
