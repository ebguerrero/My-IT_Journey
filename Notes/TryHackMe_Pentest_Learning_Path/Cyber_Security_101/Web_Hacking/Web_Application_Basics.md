# 🌐 Web Application Basics
**TryHackMe — Cyber Security 101 → Web Hacking**

---

## 🛠️ Task 1 — Introduction

### 📘 Introduction

Web applications are one of the most common ways users interact with systems on the internet today.  
From logging into email, accessing banking portals, using cloud services, or interacting with APIs, **web applications are everywhere**.

To properly test, secure, or attack a web application, it is essential to understand **how web applications work at a fundamental level**. This includes how browsers communicate with servers, how data is transferred, and how different components interact behind the scenes.

This room introduces the **core building blocks of web applications** and explains how they communicate using HTTP. These concepts form the foundation for web application security and penetration testing.

---

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this room, you will be able to:

- Understand what a **web application** is and how it operates in a browser
- Identify and explain the **components of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)**
- Understand how **HTTP requests and HTTP responses** are structured
- Recognize different **HTTP request methods** and their purposes
- Interpret **HTTP response status codes** and what they indicate
- Understand how **HTTP headers** influence communication and security
- Identify common **security headers** and why they are important

These objectives will be revisited at the end of the room to reinforce what each task covered.

---

### 🧠 Why This Matters for Security

Every interaction between a user and a web application happens through **HTTP communication**.  
Attackers do not “hack websites” in the abstract — they manipulate:

- URLs
- HTTP requests
- HTTP responses
- Headers
- Parameters
- Methods

A strong understanding of these basics allows you to:

- Diagnose broken application behavior
- Identify insecure configurations
- Understand how common web attacks work
- Confidently move into hands-on web exploitation

Without this foundation, advanced tools like **Burp Suite**, **OWASP testing**, and **API hacking** will feel confusing or overwhelming.


Good — **Task 1 locked in** ✅
We’ll keep this disciplined.

Below is **Task 2 only**, written at **junior-pentester depth**, no shortcuts, no analogies, no compression. This is **copy/paste ready** and intended to **teach**, not summarize.

---

## 🛠️ Task 2 — Web Application Overview

### 📘 What Is a Web Application?

A **web application** is a program that:

1. Runs on a **server**
2. Is accessed through a **web browser** over a network (usually the internet)

Unlike traditional desktop applications, web applications do **not** run entirely on the user’s computer. Instead, the browser acts as an interface that communicates with a remote system using **HTTP**.

Every time a user:
- visits a website
- submits a form
- logs in
- interacts with an API

…the browser and server exchange **HTTP messages** behind the scenes.

To understand web hacking and web security, you must understand **where code runs, what the user can see, and what the user cannot control**.

---

## 🧩 Core Components of a Web Application

A web application is made up of **two primary components** that work together:

- **Front End (Client-Side)**
- **Back End (Server-Side)**

Each component has a **different role**, a **different trust level**, and a **different attack surface**.

---

## 🎨 Front End (Client-Side)

The **front end** is everything that runs **inside the user’s web browser**.

This includes **all content sent from the server to the browser**, which means it is:
- fully visible
- fully inspectable
- fully modifiable by the user

The front end is built using three main technologies.

---

### 🧱 HTML — Structure

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** defines the **structure** of a webpage.

It determines:
- what elements exist
- how content is organized
- where input fields and buttons appear

Examples of HTML elements:
- forms
- text fields
- buttons
- links
- images

HTML does **not** enforce security or logic. It only defines *what exists* on the page.

---

### 🎨 CSS — Presentation

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** controls **how the webpage looks**.

It manages:
- colors
- fonts
- spacing
- layout
- animations

CSS has little direct impact on security, but it can:
- reveal application structure
- expose hidden elements
- assist attackers in understanding page behavior

---

### ⚙️ JavaScript — Behavior

**JavaScript** controls **logic and interaction in the browser**.

It is responsible for:
- form validation
- dynamic content updates
- user interaction handling
- sending HTTP requests (fetch, AJAX)
- updating the page without reloading

JavaScript executes **entirely on the client side**.

---

### 🔐 Why the Front End Matters for Pentesters

Because front-end code is sent to the user:
- attackers can view it
- attackers can modify it
- attackers can bypass it

Client-side controls **cannot be trusted** for security.

Common front-end related attacks include:
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- DOM-based injection
- Client-side validation bypass
- API endpoint discovery through JavaScript files

Anything enforced only in JavaScript **can be bypassed**.

---

## 🖥️ Back End (Server-Side)

The **back end** is everything that runs **on the server**, out of sight of the user.

This is where:
- security decisions must be enforced
- sensitive data is processed
- application logic is executed

Unlike the front end, users **cannot directly see or modify** back-end code — but they can influence it through crafted HTTP requests.

---

### 🧠 Application Logic

Application logic is the **server-side code** that defines how the application behaves.

It is written in languages such as:
- Python (Flask, Django)
- Node.js (Express)
- PHP
- Java (Spring)
- Ruby
- Go

Application logic handles:
- authentication (login)
- authorization (permissions)
- processing form input
- interacting with databases
- generating responses

#### Security relevance:
- Broken logic leads to broken access control
- Missing validation enables injection attacks
- Logic flaws often lead to privilege escalation

---

### 🗃️ Database

The **database** stores persistent data, such as:
- user accounts
- passwords
- messages
- transactions
- configuration data

Common database types:
- **SQL** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL)
- **NoSQL** (MongoDB, Redis)

#### Security relevance:
- SQL Injection
- NoSQL Injection
- Weak password hashing
- Exposed backups
- Excessive permissions

Databases are often the **ultimate target** of attackers.

---

### 🖥️ Infrastructure Components

Infrastructure refers to the **underlying systems that support the web application**.

This includes:
- web servers (Apache, Nginx, IIS)
- application servers
- storage systems
- networking components
- load balancers
- reverse proxies
- cloud services
- supporting system software

Infrastructure enables:
- request routing
- scalability
- availability
- secure communication

#### Security relevance:
- Misconfigurations expose services
- SSRF can reach internal systems
- Poor isolation can lead to full environment compromise
- Cloud metadata services may leak credentials

Understanding infrastructure is critical for **advanced web attacks**.

---

### 🛡️ Web Application Firewall (WAF)

A **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** sits in front of the application and inspects HTTP traffic.

It attempts to block:
- SQL injection patterns
- XSS payloads
- automated attacks
- malicious scanners

Important note:
A WAF **does not fix vulnerabilities**.  
It only reduces exposure by filtering known attack patterns.

Skilled attackers can often **bypass WAFs**.

---

## 🧠 How Front End and Back End Work Together

Example: User logs in.

**Front end:**
- Displays login form
- Collects username and password
- Sends HTTP request to server

**Back end:**
- Validates credentials
- Checks permissions
- Queries database
- Creates session
- Returns response

If the back end is insecure, the application fails — even if the front end looks perfect.

We’re now **cleanly aligned**, so here is **Task 3**, done **properly**, at **junior-pentester depth**, with **no omitted explanations**, **no shortcuts**, and **explicit security context**.

This is **copy/paste ready Markdown** and fits directly under Task 2.

---


## 🛠️ Task 3 — Uniform Resource Locator (URL)

### 📘 What Is a URL?

A **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)** is the address used to access resources on the internet.  
It tells your browser **where to go**, **how to get there**, and **what resource to request**.

A URL can point to:
- A webpage
- An API endpoint
- An image or file
- A video
- Any other web-accessible resource

Understanding URLs is critical because **users, browsers, servers, and attackers all interact with web applications through URLs**.

---

## 🧩 Anatomy of a URL

Example URL (as shown in the lesson):

```

[http://user:password@tryhackme.com:80/view-room?id=1#task3](http://user:password@tryhackme.com:80/view-room?id=1#task3)

```

Textualized breakdown of the image:

```

┌────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐ ┌────┐ ┌───────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐
│ Scheme │://│ User Info     │ @ │ Host / Domain│ :80  │ / Path     │ ? Query   │ # Fragment│
└────────┘   └──────────────┘   └──────────────┘ └────┘ └───────────┘ └──────────┘ └──────────┘

```

Each part of the URL has a **specific purpose** and plays a role in how the request is processed.

---

## 🔹 Scheme

Examples:
```

http
https

```

The **scheme** defines the **protocol** used to access the resource.

Common schemes:
- **HTTP** — HyperText Transfer Protocol
- **HTTPS** — HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure

### Why this matters:
- HTTPS encrypts data in transit
- Protects credentials, cookies, and sensitive information
- Prevents man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks

Modern browsers strongly discourage or block non-HTTPS content.

---

## 🔹 User (User Information)

Example:
```

user:password@

```

The **user section** allows credentials to be embedded directly in the URL.

### Important notes:
- This feature exists for legacy reasons
- Rarely used today
- Considered insecure

### Security implications:
- Credentials in URLs can be logged
- Stored in browser history
- Leaked through referrer headers

If you ever encounter credentials in a URL, it is a **serious security issue**.

---

## 🔹 Host / Domain

Example:
```

tryhackme.com

```

The **host (domain)** identifies the **server** that the browser should connect to.

### Key points:
- Domains must be unique
- DNS resolves domains to IP addresses
- Users rely on domains to determine trust

### Security relevance:
Attackers often abuse domains using:
- **Typosquatting** (misspelled domains)
- Look-alike domains
- Homograph attacks

These techniques are commonly used in **phishing attacks**.

---

## 🔹 Port

Example:
```

:80

```

The **port** specifies **which service** on the server should handle the request.

Common ports:
- **80** — HTTP
- **443** — HTTPS

Valid port range:
```

1–65535

```

### Security relevance:
- Non-standard ports may expose:
  - Admin interfaces
  - Development services
  - Legacy applications

Port scanning often reveals **unexpected attack surfaces**.

---

## 🔹 Path

Example:
```

/view-room

```

The **path** identifies the **specific resource or endpoint** on the server.

### What it does:
- Acts like a roadmap to content
- Maps to files, routes, or API endpoints

### Pentester relevance:
Paths are commonly targeted for:
- **Forced browsing**
- **Directory traversal**
- **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**
- Hidden admin panels

Attackers frequently manipulate paths to access unauthorized resources.

---

## 🔹 Query String

Example:
```

?id=1

```

The **query string** begins with a `?` and passes **additional data** to the server.

### Key characteristics:
- Consists of key=value pairs
- Fully controlled by the user
- Easily modified

### Security relevance:
Query strings are a **major attack surface**:
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Parameter manipulation
- Logic flaws

Any data received via the query string must be validated server-side.

---

## 🔹 Fragment

Example:
```

#task3

```

The **fragment** points to a specific section of a webpage.

### Important behavior:
- Processed entirely by the browser
- **Not sent to the server**

### Security note:
Although fragments aren’t sent to the server, they can still be abused in:
- Client-side JavaScript
- DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities

---

## 🔐 Why Understanding URLs Matters for Pentesters

URLs define:
- Where requests go
- What data is sent
- What resources are accessed

Attackers manipulate URLs to:
- Inject malicious input
- Access unauthorized data
- Bypass security controls

A pentester must be comfortable **reading, modifying, and abusing URLs**.
