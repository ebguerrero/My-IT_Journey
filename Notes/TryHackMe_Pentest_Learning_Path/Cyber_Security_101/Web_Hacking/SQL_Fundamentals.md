# 🧠 Web Hacking → SQL Fundamentals

## 📘 Task 1: Introduction

---

## 🔍 Why Databases Matter in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is a broad field covering many disciplines, but **databases are one of the most critical and ubiquitous components** across nearly all security roles and scenarios.

Whether you are:

* Securing a **web application**
* Working in a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** using a **SIEM**
* Managing **user authentication and access control**
* Performing **malware analysis or threat detection**
* Conducting **penetration testing or red team operations**

👉 **You will almost certainly interact with databases** in some capacity.

### From an Offensive Security Perspective (Attacker / Pentester)

Databases are often the **end target** of attacks because they store:

* Usernames and passwords
* Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
* API keys and secrets
* Financial records
* Application logic dependencies

Understanding SQL allows an attacker (or pentester) to:

* Identify and exploit **SQL Injection (SQLi)** vulnerabilities
* Manipulate queries to **bypass authentication**
* Retrieve sensitive data from compromised services
* Modify or destroy records (impacting integrity and availability)

> ⚠️ Many real-world breaches occur not because SQL exists — but because it is **poorly understood or improperly secured**.

---

### From a Defensive Security Perspective (Blue Team / Engineer)

On the defensive side, SQL knowledge enables you to:

* Navigate databases to **investigate suspicious activity**
* Validate whether malicious queries were executed
* Implement **restrictions, permissions, and least privilege**
* Design safer query logic and input validation
* Monitor logs for anomalous database behavior

👉 **You cannot defend what you don’t understand.**

---

## 🗄️ Why This Room Exists

# 🟦 Task 2 — Databases 101

---

## 📘 Introducing Databases

Before learning SQL, it’s critical to understand **what databases are**, **why they exist**, and **how they are structured**, because nearly every web application you will test as a pentester stores data in a database.

Databases are used everywhere in cybersecurity, including:

* Web applications (user accounts, passwords, posts, payments)
* SOC environments (logs, alerts, incidents)
* SIEM platforms (event ingestion and correlation)
* Authentication and access control systems
* Malware analysis and threat intelligence platforms

From an **offensive security** perspective:

* Databases are often the **end target** of attacks
* SQL Injection vulnerabilities allow attackers to:

  * Read sensitive data
  * Modify records
  * Delete tables
  * Escalate privileges
  * Achieve remote code execution (in some cases)

From a **defensive security** perspective:

* Databases help analysts:

  * Track suspicious activity
  * Audit access logs
  * Correlate events
  * Enforce access controls and restrictions

Because databases are **ubiquitous**, understanding them is foundational to web hacking.

---

## 🧠 What Is a Database?

A **database** is a structured collection of data that allows information to be:

* Stored
* Retrieved
* Updated
* Deleted
* Queried efficiently

Databases are designed to handle **large volumes of data** while maintaining **integrity, accuracy, and performance**.

---

## 🧩 Types of Databases

Databases generally fall into two major categories:

---

## 🗂️ Relational Databases (SQL Databases)

Relational databases store data in **tables** made up of:

* **Rows** (records)
* **Columns** (fields)

Each table has a defined structure (schema), and relationships can exist between tables.

### Common Relational Databases:

* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* MariaDB
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Oracle Database

### Characteristics:

* Structured schema
* Uses SQL (Structured Query Language)
* Enforces data integrity
* Supports relationships via keys

### Example Use Cases:

* User authentication systems
* E-commerce platforms
* Financial applications

---

## 🗃️ Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL Databases)

Non-relational databases store data in **non-tabular formats**.

### Types of NoSQL Databases:

* **Key-Value** (Redis)
* **Document-Based** (MongoDB)
* **Wide-Column** (Cassandra)
* **Graph** (Neo4j)

### Characteristics:

* Flexible schema
* Optimized for scalability
* Often used in big data and cloud environments

### Pentesting Note:

Even though SQL Injection targets relational databases, **NoSQL Injection** is also a real attack vector.

---

## 🧱 Tables, Rows, and Columns (Core Concepts)

Relational databases organize data into **tables**.

### Conceptual Table Example: `books`

```
+----+--------------------------+----------------+
| id | name                     | published_date|
+----+--------------------------+----------------+
| 1  | Android Security Internals| 2014-10-14     |
| 2  | Bug Bounty Bootcamp       | 2021-11-16     |
| 3  | Car Hacker's Handbook     | 2016-02-25     |
| 4  | Designing Secure Software | 2021-12-21     |
| 5  | Ethical Hacking           | 2021-11-02     |
+----+--------------------------+----------------+
```

### Definitions:

* **Table**: A collection of related data
* **Row**: A single record (one book)
* **Column**: A specific attribute (name, date, etc.)

---

## 🔑 Primary Keys

A **Primary Key** is a column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row.

### Characteristics:

* Must be **unique**
* Cannot be **NULL**
* Only one primary key per table

### Example:

```
id INT PRIMARY KEY
```

This ensures:

* Each row can be referenced precisely
* Queries are efficient
* Relationships can be formed

---

## 🔗 Foreign Keys

A **Foreign Key** is a column that creates a relationship between two tables.

### Conceptual Example:

#### `books` table:

```
author_id INT
```

#### `authors` table:

```
id INT PRIMARY KEY
```

Here:

* `books.author_id` → references `authors.id`

This creates a **relationship** between books and authors.

### Why This Matters for Pentesters:

* Foreign keys reveal **data relationships**
* Exploiting SQL Injection often involves:

  * Enumerating related tables
  * Pivoting through foreign key relationships

---

## 🔐 Why Structure Matters for Security

Well-designed databases:

* Prevent inconsistent data
* Reduce attack surface
* Make access controls enforceable

Poorly designed databases:

* Leak excessive data
* Enable privilege escalation
* Make injection attacks more damaging

---

## 🧠 Pentester Takeaway

As a junior pentester, you should now understand:

* What databases are and why they matter
* The difference between relational and non-relational databases
* How tables, rows, and columns work
* The role of primary and foreign keys
* Why database structure directly impacts security

This foundational knowledge is **mandatory** before learning SQL syntax and exploitation.

---

## ✅ Answer the questions below (Task 2 — Databases 101)

> **What type of database would you consider using if the data you're going to store will vary greatly in its format?**
> `non-relational database`

> **What type of database would you consider using if the data you're going to store will likely be in the same structured format?**
> `relational database`

> **In our example, one record of a book is inserted into our "books" table, it could be represented as a ____ in the table.**
> `row`

> **Which type of key provides a link from one table to another?**
> `foreign key`

> **Which type of key ensures a record is unique within a table?**
> `primary key`

---

# 🧩 Task 3 — SQL

## What is SQL?

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is the standard language used to **interact with relational databases**.
It allows users and applications to:

* **Query** data (read)
* **Insert** new data
* **Update** existing data
* **Delete** data
* **Manage database structure**

In real-world systems, SQL acts as the **bridge between applications and stored data**.

### Why SQL Matters in Cybersecurity

From a pentester’s perspective, SQL is critical because:

* Web applications often **pass user input directly into SQL queries**
* Poorly handled SQL queries can lead to **SQL Injection**
* SQL Injection can result in **data leakage, authentication bypass, or full database compromise**

---

## Databases and DBMS (Textualized Diagram Explanation)

**TryHackMe visual concept (described):**

> A central **SQL engine** sits in the middle, with arrows connecting it to:

* Users
* Applications
* Database storage
* Tables
* Queries

This diagram demonstrates that:

* SQL is **not a database itself**
* SQL is used to **communicate with a database**
* A **Database Management System (DBMS)** executes SQL commands

### Common DBMS Examples

* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* MariaDB
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Oracle Database

---

## SQL + Relational Databases

Relational databases:

* Store data in **tables**
* Use **rows** (records) and **columns** (fields)
* Enforce relationships via **primary keys** and **foreign keys**

SQL is optimized for relational databases because it:

* Understands structured data
* Enforces schema rules
* Supports relationships across tables

---

## Benefits of SQL and Relational Databases

### ⚡ Fast

Relational databases are highly optimized and can:

* Query massive datasets quickly
* Use indexes to improve performance

### 📖 Easy to Learn

* SQL reads like English
* Commands such as `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE` are intuitive

### 🎯 Reliable

* Enforces data consistency
* Prevents invalid data insertion via schemas

### 🔍 Flexible

* Can filter, sort, group, and aggregate data
* Supports complex queries useful for analytics and for attackers

---

## Getting Hands-On with SQL (MySQL)

### Starting the Environment

In TryHackMe, you are instructed to:

1. Click **Start Machine**
2. Open the terminal
3. Run the following command:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

### What This Means

* `mysql` → launches the MySQL client
* `-u root` → logs in as the root user
* `-p` → prompts for a password

### After Entering the Password

You see output similar to:

```
Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is X
Server version: 8.0.xx Ubuntu
```

This confirms:

* You are connected to MySQL
* You can now issue SQL commands directly

---

## Why This Matters for Pentesters

From a security perspective:

* If attackers gain DB access, they often land **exactly here**
* SQL consoles allow **full control over stored data**
* SQL injection aims to **force applications to execute SQL commands on behalf of attackers**

Understanding **how SQL works legitimately** is mandatory before learning how it is abused.

---

## 🧠 Pentester Takeaway

* SQL is the **language of databases**
* DBMS executes SQL commands
* Web apps often act as a **proxy between users and SQL**
* Any place user input reaches SQL is a **potential attack surface**
* Mastering SQL is foundational for:

  * SQL Injection
  * Database enumeration
  * Data exfiltration

---

# 🧩 Task 4 — Database and Table Statements

**Path:** Cyber Security 101 → Web Hacking → SQL Fundamentals

---

## 🕒 Time to Learn

Now that we understand **what SQL is** and **how to interact with a database**, this task focuses on **how databases and tables are actually created, viewed, modified, and removed**.

This task introduces:

* **Database-level statements**
* **Table-level statements**
* How SQL structures data **before** any queries, filtering, or attacks can occur

> 🔐 **Pentester mindset:**
> You cannot exploit, enumerate, or inject into a database if you don’t understand **how it’s structured**. These statements define the **attack surface**.

---

## 🗄️ Database Statements

### 📌 CREATE DATABASE

Before storing any data, a **database must exist**.

**Syntax:**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

**TryHackMe Example:**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE the_bookmarket_db;
```

📘 **What this does:**

* Creates a new database container
* Holds tables, views, users, and permissions

🔐 **Pentesting relevance:**

* SQL Injection often targets **existing databases**
* Knowing naming conventions helps during enumeration (`information_schema` abuse)

---

### 📌 SHOW DATABASES

To view all databases available on the server:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

📘 **What THM shows conceptually:**

* A list of databases including:

  * User-created databases
  * Default system databases like:

    * `mysql`
    * `information_schema`
    * `performance_schema`
    * `sys`

🔐 **Pentester relevance:**

* `information_schema` is **critical** for SQL injection
* Attackers use it to enumerate:

  * Tables
  * Columns
  * Users
  * Permissions

---

### 📌 USE DATABASE

Before interacting with tables, SQL needs to know **which database is active**.

```sql
USE the_bookmarket_db;
```

📘 **What this means:**

* All subsequent queries apply **only** to this database
* Similar to `cd` in Linux

🔐 **Pentester relevance:**

* Injection payloads often rely on knowing or guessing the active database
* Misconfigured apps sometimes expose this implicitly

---

### 📌 DROP DATABASE

Deletes a database **permanently**.

```sql
DROP DATABASE database_name;
```

⚠️ **Dangerous operation**

* Removes all tables and data
* Irreversible unless backups exist

🔐 **Pentester relevance:**

* Rarely allowed in real environments
* But **misconfigured privileges** can allow destructive attacks

---

## 📋 Table Statements

Once inside a database, **tables store the actual data**.

---

### 📌 CREATE TABLE

Defines the **structure of stored data**.

**Generic syntax:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE example_table (
    example_column1 data_type,
    example_column2 data_type,
    example_column3 data_type
);
```

---

### 📘 TryHackMe Example: Creating `book_inventory`

```sql
CREATE TABLE book_inventory (
    book_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    book_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    publication_date DATE
);
```

#### 🔍 Column Breakdown

| Column             | Meaning                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `book_id`          | Unique numeric identifier    |
| `INT`              | Integer data type            |
| `AUTO_INCREMENT`   | Automatically increases      |
| `PRIMARY KEY`      | Uniquely identifies each row |
| `book_name`        | Title of the book            |
| `VARCHAR(255)`     | Variable-length string       |
| `NOT NULL`         | Field must contain data      |
| `publication_date` | Date field                   |

🔐 **Pentester relevance:**

* Primary keys are frequently used in **WHERE clauses**
* Knowing data types helps craft **type-aware SQL injection payloads**

---

### 📌 SHOW TABLES

Lists all tables in the **currently active database**.

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

📘 **What THM shows:**

* A list including `book_inventory`

🔐 **Pentester relevance:**

* During SQLi, attackers enumerate table names
* `SHOW TABLES` logic is mirrored via `information_schema.tables`

---

### 📌 DESCRIBE Table Structure

Shows **exact column definitions**.

```sql
DESCRIBE book_inventory;
```

📘 **THM Output Explained Conceptually:**

| Field            | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ---- | --- | ------- | -------------- |
| book_id          | int          | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| book_name        | varchar(255) | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| publication_date | date         | YES  |     | NULL    |                |

🔐 **Pentester relevance:**

* Column names and data types are prime SQLi targets
* Attackers try to extract **specific columns** (passwords, emails, API keys)

---

### 📌 ALTER TABLE

Used to **modify existing tables**.

#### Example: Adding a Column

```sql
ALTER TABLE book_inventory
ADD page_count INT;
```

📘 **What this does:**

* Adds a new column named `page_count`
* Existing rows get `NULL` unless otherwise specified

🔐 **Pentester relevance:**

* ALTER privileges should **never** be granted to application users
* Misuse can enable data manipulation attacks

---

### 📌 DROP TABLE

Deletes a table and all its data.

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

⚠️ **Permanent operation**

🔐 **Pentester relevance:**

* Similar to `DROP DATABASE`
* Indicates severe misconfiguration if exploitable

---

## 🧠 Mental Model (Visualized in Text)

```
Database (the_bookmarket_db)
│
├── Table: book_inventory
│   ├── book_id (INT, PK, AUTO_INCREMENT)
│   ├── book_name (VARCHAR)
│   ├── publication_date (DATE)
│   └── page_count (INT)
```

---

## 🎯 Pentester Takeaways

* **Databases** are containers; **tables** hold data
* **Primary keys** uniquely identify records
* **Data types** dictate valid input → critical for SQL injection
* Enumeration relies on understanding **structure before content**
* Many real-world attacks fail because attackers don’t know table schemas

---

## 🛠️ Task 5 — CRUD Operations

### 📘 What is CRUD?

**CRUD** stands for the four fundamental operations that can be performed on data in a database:

- **Create** → Add new data
- **Read** → Retrieve existing data
- **Update** → Modify existing data
- **Delete** → Remove data

These operations are the backbone of **any data-driven application**, including:
- Web applications
- APIs
- Authentication systems
- Logging systems
- Administrative dashboards

From a **pentesting perspective**, CRUD operations are critical because:
- SQL Injection targets **CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE**
- Broken access controls often allow unauthorized CRUD actions
- Data exfiltration usually happens through **READ (SELECT)** queries
- Data destruction happens through **DELETE**

In this task, we interact with the `books` table inside the `tools_db` database using MySQL.

---

## 🟢 Create Operation (INSERT)

### 📌 Purpose

The **Create** operation inserts a **new record (row)** into a database table.

---

### 🔹 SQL Syntax

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
````

---

### 🧪 TryHackMe Example

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO books (id, name, published_date, description)
VALUES (1, 'Android Security Internals', '2014-10-14',
'An In-Depth Guide to Android\'s Security Architecture');
```

---

### 🧪 Input Explained

* `INSERT INTO books`
  → Specifies that a new row will be added to the **books** table.

* `(id, name, published_date, description)`
  → Explicitly lists **which columns** will receive data.
  This prevents errors and protects against column-order changes.

* `VALUES (...)`
  → Supplies the actual data for each column **in the same order**.

* `id = 1`
  → Manually assigns the primary key value.

* `'2014-10-14'`
  → Uses MySQL’s required **YYYY-MM-DD** date format.

* `\'`
  → Escapes the apostrophe inside the string so MySQL parses it correctly.

---

### 📤 Output Explained

```text
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
```

This confirms:

* One row was successfully inserted
* The query executed without constraint violations

---

### 🔐 Pentester Insight

If user input reaches an `INSERT` query without validation:

* Attackers can create rogue users
* Inject malicious data
* Poison application state

---

## 🔵 Read Operation (SELECT)

### 📌 Purpose

The **Read** operation retrieves existing data from a database.

---

### 🔹 SQL Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
```

---

### 🧪 TryHackMe Example (Read All Columns)

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM books;
```

---

### 🧪 Input Explained

* `SELECT`
  → Tells MySQL to **retrieve data**.

* `*`
  → Indicates **all columns** should be returned.

* `FROM books`
  → Specifies the source table.

This form is common in:

* Development
* Enumeration
* SQL Injection attacks

---

### 📤 Output Explained

```text
+----+---------------------------+---------------+---------------------------------------------+
| id | name                      | published_date | description                                |
+----+---------------------------+---------------+---------------------------------------------+
|  1 | Android Security Internals | 2014-10-14    | An In-Depth Guide to Android's Security... |
+----+---------------------------+---------------+---------------------------------------------+
```

Each row represents **one record** in the table.

---

### 🧪 TryHackMe Example (Read Specific Columns)

```sql
mysql> SELECT name, description FROM books;
```

---

### 🧪 Input Explained

* `SELECT name, description`
  → Limits output to **specific columns**, reducing data exposure.

* This is best practice for production systems.

---

### 📤 Output Explained

```text
+---------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| name                      | description                                |
+---------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Android Security Internals | An In-Depth Guide to Android's Security... |
+---------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
```

---

### 🔐 Pentester Insight

* SQL injection almost always abuses `SELECT`
* `SELECT *` is a red flag in production code
* Sensitive fields should never be selectable by default

---

## 🟡 Update Operation (UPDATE)

### 📌 Purpose

The **Update** operation modifies **existing records**.

---

### 🔹 SQL Syntax

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column = new_value
WHERE condition;
```

⚠️ **WARNING**
Without a `WHERE` clause, **every row will be updated**.

---

### 🧪 TryHackMe Example

```sql
mysql> UPDATE books
SET description = 'An In-Depth Guide to Android\'s Security Architecture.'
WHERE id = 1;
```

---

### 🧪 Input Explained

* `UPDATE books`
  → Targets the **books** table.

* `SET description = ...`
  → Specifies which column is being changed and its new value.

* `WHERE id = 1`
  → Restricts the update to **one specific record**.
  Without this clause, **all rows would be modified**.

---

### 📤 Output Explained

```text
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0
```

* `Rows matched` → Rows that met the condition
* `Changed` → Rows actually modified

---

### 🔐 Pentester Insight

Insecure UPDATE logic can allow attackers to:

* Change user roles
* Reset passwords
* Alter financial or audit data

---

## 🔴 Delete Operation (DELETE)

### 📌 Purpose

The **Delete** operation permanently removes data.

---

### 🔹 SQL Syntax

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNING**

```sql
DELETE FROM books;
```

➡️ **Deletes ALL records**

---

### 🧪 TryHackMe Example

```sql
mysql> DELETE FROM books WHERE id = 1;
```

---

### 🧪 Input Explained

* `DELETE FROM books`
  → Targets the **books** table.

* `WHERE id = 1`
  → Ensures only **one specific row** is removed.

This condition is the **only thing preventing full data loss**.

---

### 📤 Output Explained

```text
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
```

The record is **permanently removed** unless backups exist.

---

### 🔐 Pentester Insight

DELETE vulnerabilities can:

* Destroy application data
* Cause denial of service
* Be weaponized through SQL injection

---

## 🧠 CRUD Summary

| Operation | SQL Keyword | Purpose       |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Create    | INSERT      | Add data      |
| Read      | SELECT      | Retrieve data |
| Update    | UPDATE      | Modify data   |
| Delete    | DELETE      | Remove data   |

# 🧩 Task 6 — Clauses

**(TryHackMe: SQL Fundamentals)**

---

## 📘 What Is a SQL Clause?

A **clause** is a component of a SQL statement that defines **how data is filtered, grouped, sorted, or restricted**.

Clauses allow you to:

* Control **which rows** are returned
* Control **how results are grouped**
* Control **how results are ordered**
* Apply **conditions after aggregation**

In previous tasks, we already used some clauses implicitly:

* `FROM` → specifies the table
* `WHERE` → filters records

In this task, we focus on the following clauses:

* `DISTINCT`
* `GROUP BY`
* `ORDER BY`
* `HAVING`

We will continue using the **`books` table** inside the **`tools_db` database**.

---

## 🔹 DISTINCT Clause

### 📌 Purpose

The `DISTINCT` clause is used to **remove duplicate rows** from query results and return **only unique values**.

This is especially useful when:

* Data contains duplicates
* You want a clean list of categories, names, or attributes
* You are preparing data for aggregation or reporting

---

### 🧪 TryHackMe Example — Without DISTINCT

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM books;
```

#### 🧠 Input Explained

* `SELECT *` → retrieve **all columns**
* `FROM books` → query the `books` table
* No filtering or deduplication is applied

#### 📤 Output Explained

* All rows from the `books` table are displayed
* The book **“Ethical Hacking” appears twice**, meaning duplicates exist in the dataset

---

### 🧪 TryHackMe Example — With DISTINCT

```sql
mysql> SELECT DISTINCT name FROM books;
```

#### 🧠 Input Explained

* `DISTINCT name` → return **unique values** from the `name` column only
* Duplicate book names are collapsed into a single row

#### 📤 Output Explained

* Only **unique book names** are shown
* “Ethical Hacking” now appears **once**
* Total rows decrease from 6 → 5

---

### 🛡️ Pentester Insight

* `DISTINCT` is commonly abused during **SQL Injection enumeration**
* Attackers use it to:

  * Identify unique table names
  * Identify unique column values
  * Reduce noise when dumping data

---

## 🔹 GROUP BY Clause

### 📌 Purpose

The `GROUP BY` clause is used to **group rows that share the same value** and is typically used with **aggregate functions** like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`.

---

### 🧪 TryHackMe Example

```sql
mysql> SELECT name, COUNT(*)
FROM books
GROUP BY name;
```

#### 🧠 Input Explained

* `SELECT name, COUNT(*)`

  * `name` → grouping column
  * `COUNT(*)` → counts how many rows exist per name
* `GROUP BY name`

  * Groups rows that share the same book name

#### 📤 Output Explained

* Each unique book name is shown once
* The `COUNT(*)` column shows how many times each book appears
* “Ethical Hacking” shows a count of **2**, confirming duplication

---

### 🛡️ Pentester Insight

* `GROUP BY` is often abused during:

  * **Blind SQL Injection**
  * **Data inference attacks**
* Attackers use `GROUP BY` to:

  * Detect duplicated values
  * Validate guessed data structures

---

## 🔹 ORDER BY Clause

### 📌 Purpose

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to **sort query results** in either ascending or descending order.

---

### 🔼 Ascending Order (ASC)

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
FROM books
ORDER BY published_date ASC;
```

#### 🧠 Input Explained

* `ORDER BY published_date ASC`

  * Sorts rows by `published_date`
  * Oldest → newest

#### 📤 Output Explained

* Books are listed from **earliest publication date to latest**
* `ASC` is the **default** order if not specified

---

### 🔽 Descending Order (DESC)

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
FROM books
ORDER BY published_date DESC;
```

#### 🧠 Input Explained

* `DESC` reverses the sort order
* Newest books appear first

#### 📤 Output Explained

* Books are listed from **latest to earliest publication date**

---

### 🛡️ Pentester Insight

* `ORDER BY` is frequently used during **SQL Injection testing**
* Attackers exploit it to:

  * Identify column counts (`ORDER BY 1`, `ORDER BY 2`, etc.)
  * Trigger SQL errors for enumeration

---

## 🔹 HAVING Clause

### 📌 Purpose

The `HAVING` clause is used to **filter grouped results** after aggregation.

🔴 Important distinction:

* `WHERE` → filters **before** grouping
* `HAVING` → filters **after** grouping

---

### 🧪 TryHackMe Example

```sql
mysql> SELECT name, COUNT(*)
FROM books
GROUP BY name
HAVING name LIKE '%hack%';
```

#### 🧠 Input Explained

* `GROUP BY name` groups books by name
* `COUNT(*)` counts occurrences per group
* `HAVING name LIKE '%hack%'`

  * Filters grouped results
  * Only includes names containing the word **“hack”**

#### 📤 Output Explained

* Only books with “hack” in the title are returned
* Correct counts are preserved for each grouped result

---

### 🛡️ Pentester Insight

* `HAVING` is extremely powerful in **blind SQL injection**
* Attackers use it when:

  * `WHERE` is blocked
  * Conditions must be applied after aggregation
* Often used to bypass input filters

---

## ✅ Answer the Questions Below

**Using the `tools_db` database, what is the total number of distinct categories in the `hacking_tools` table?**
➡️ `6`

**Using the `tools_db` database, what is the first tool (by name) in ascending order from the `hacking_tools` table?**
➡️ `Bash Bunny`

**Using the `tools_db` database, what is the first tool (by name) in descending order from the `hacking_tools` table?**
➡️ `Wi-Fi Pineapple`

---

## 🧠 Final Pentester Takeaway (Task 6)

* Clauses control **precision and structure**
* `DISTINCT` cleans data
* `GROUP BY` reveals patterns
* `ORDER BY` exposes structure
* `HAVING` bypasses filters

Together, these clauses are **core primitives** for:

* SQL Injection
* Data enumeration
* Data inference
* Exploitation chains

---

## 🧮 Task 7 — Operators

When working with SQL and dealing with logic and comparisons, **operators** are how we filter, include, exclude, and compare data. Understanding these operators helps you write **precise queries**, and in pentesting, it helps you recognize what an app is doing (and what it *might* be vulnerable to if it builds queries unsafely).

In this task, we continue using the **books** table inside the **tools_db** database.

---

# ✅ Logical Operators

Logical operators test conditions and return **TRUE** or **FALSE**, usually inside a `WHERE` clause.

---

## 🔎 LIKE Operator

The `LIKE` operator is commonly used with `WHERE` to search for **patterns** inside text.

### 🧪 TryHackMe Example
```sql
mysql> SELECT *
    -> FROM books
    -> WHERE description LIKE "%guide%";
````

### 🧠 Input Explained (line-by-line)

#### `SELECT *`

* `SELECT` = tells MySQL you want to **retrieve data** (read).
* `*` (asterisk) = **all columns** from the table (id, name, published_date, description, category, etc.).

  * If you only want specific columns, you’d list them: `SELECT name, category`.

#### `FROM books`

* `FROM` tells MySQL **which table** to pull the rows from.
* `books` is the table name that contains the records.

#### `WHERE description LIKE "%guide%"`

* `WHERE` filters rows — **only return rows that match this condition**.
* `description` is the specific **column** being tested.
* `LIKE` means “match a pattern” (pattern matching for text).
* `"%guide%"` is the pattern:

  * `%` means “**any number of characters** (including zero)”
  * So `%guide%` means:
    ✅ match any description that contains the substring **guide** anywhere inside it

    * `A Guide to Developers` ✅
    * `Guide for Penetration Tester` ✅
    * `guid` ❌ (doesn’t contain “guide” exactly)

📌 **Why this matters in pentesting**

* `LIKE` is extremely common in search features.
* Search endpoints are frequent targets for **SQL injection** if user input is inserted unsafely into a query.

### 📤 Output Explained (what THM shows)

* The output returns rows whose `description` contains the word **guide**.
* You’ll see multiple matching books returned.

---

## ✅ AND Operator

The `AND` operator combines conditions and returns TRUE only if **all** conditions are TRUE.

### 🧪 TryHackMe Example

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
    -> FROM books
    -> WHERE category = "Offensive Security" AND name = "Bug Bounty Bootcamp";
```

### 🧠 Input Explained (line-by-line)

#### `SELECT *`

* Return **all columns** for matching rows.

#### `FROM books`

* Query is operating against the `books` table.

#### `WHERE category = "Offensive Security" AND name = "Bug Bounty Bootcamp"`

Break it into two conditions:

**Condition 1:** `category = "Offensive Security"`

* `category` column must match exactly the string **Offensive Security**
* `=` means exact match (case sensitivity depends on collation)

**AND**

* means both conditions must be true for a row to be returned

**Condition 2:** `name = "Bug Bounty Bootcamp"`

* `name` column must match exactly **Bug Bounty Bootcamp**

📌 **Why this matters in pentesting**

* Applications often chain multiple filters together.
* SQL injection payloads often have to account for logic like `AND` by forcing conditions to evaluate true.

### 📤 Output Explained

* Only **one** row matches both conditions, so you get a single book returned.

---

## ✅ OR Operator

The `OR` operator returns TRUE if **at least one** condition is TRUE.

### 🧪 TryHackMe Example

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
    -> FROM books
    -> WHERE name LIKE "%Android%" OR name LIKE "%iOS%";
```

### 🧠 Input Explained (line-by-line)

#### `SELECT *`

* Return all columns.

#### `FROM books`

* Pull rows from `books`.

#### `WHERE name LIKE "%Android%" OR name LIKE "%iOS%"`

Two separate pattern checks:

**Condition 1:** `name LIKE "%Android%"`

* match rows where `name` contains “Android” anywhere

**OR**

* if condition 1 is false, MySQL still accepts the row if condition 2 is true

**Condition 2:** `name LIKE "%iOS%"`

* match rows where `name` contains “iOS” anywhere

📌 **Why this matters in pentesting**

* Search filters with `OR` are common.
* In injection scenarios, attackers often try to use OR to force a condition like:

  * `... OR 1=1` (classic pattern)

### 📤 Output Explained

* The output includes any row whose name matches either Android or iOS.
* In the example, it returns books matching those patterns.

---

## 🚫 NOT Operator

The `NOT` operator negates a condition (turns TRUE → FALSE, FALSE → TRUE).

### 🧪 TryHackMe Example

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
    -> FROM books
    -> WHERE NOT description LIKE "%guide%";
```

### 🧠 Input Explained (line-by-line)

#### `SELECT *`

* Return all columns.

#### `FROM books`

* Use `books` table.

#### `WHERE NOT description LIKE "%guide%"`

* First, evaluate `description LIKE "%guide%"`

  * would normally return rows containing “guide”
* `NOT` flips the logic:

  * return rows where description **does NOT** contain “guide”

📌 **Why this matters in pentesting**

* Useful for excluding results, but also important for understanding filtering logic when testing edge cases.
* Attackers may try to bypass “blocklists” by using negation logic.

### 📤 Output Explained

* Only rows **without** “guide” in the description are shown.

---

## 🎯 BETWEEN Operator

The `BETWEEN` operator checks whether a value falls within a **range** (inclusive).

### 🧪 TryHackMe Example

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
    -> FROM books
    -> WHERE id BETWEEN 2 AND 4;
```

### 🧠 Input Explained (line-by-line)

#### `SELECT *`

* Return all columns.

#### `FROM books`

* Use the `books` table.

#### `WHERE id BETWEEN 2 AND 4`

* `id` is the column being tested
* `BETWEEN 2 AND 4` means:

  * return rows where `id >= 2` **AND** `id <= 4`
* Important detail: **BETWEEN is inclusive**

  * includes 2 and includes 4

📌 **Why this matters in pentesting**

* Range queries show up in pagination, filtering, reporting dashboards.
* If user controls bounds unsafely, could feed unexpected values.

### 📤 Output Explained

* Rows with IDs 2, 3, and 4 are returned.

---

# ✅ Comparison Operators

Comparison operators compare values and determine whether they match a criterion.

---

## 🟰 Equal To Operator (`=`)

### 🧪 TryHackMe Example

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
    -> FROM books
    -> WHERE name = "Designing Secure Software";
```

### 🧠 Input Explained

* `SELECT *` returns all columns
* `FROM books` targets the books table
* `WHERE name = "Designing Secure Software"`

  * `name` must match that string exactly
  * `=` performs an exact match comparison

### 📤 Output Explained

* Returns the single row whose name matches exactly.

---

## 🚫 Not Equal To Operator (`!=`)

### 🧪 TryHackMe Example

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
    -> FROM books
    -> WHERE category != "Offensive Security";
```

### 🧠 Input Explained

* `category != "Offensive Security"` means:

  * return rows where the category is **anything other than** Offensive Security
* `!=` is not-equal (some DBs also support `<>`)

### 📤 Output Explained

* Returns books that are not Offensive Security (ex: Defensive Security).

---

## ⬇️ Less Than Operator (`<`)

### 🧪 TryHackMe Example

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
    -> FROM books
    -> WHERE published_date < "2020-01-01";
```

### 🧠 Input Explained

* compares dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
* `published_date < "2020-01-01"` means:

  * return books published **before** Jan 1, 2020

### 📤 Output Explained

* Returns older books (published before 2020).

---

## ⬆️ Greater Than Operator (`>`)

### 🧪 TryHackMe Example

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
    -> FROM books
    -> WHERE published_date > "2020-01-01";
```

### 🧠 Input Explained

* `published_date > "2020-01-01"` means:

  * return books published **after** Jan 1, 2020

### 📤 Output Explained

* Returns books newer than 2020.

---

## ✅ Less Than or Equal (`<=`) and Greater Than or Equal (`>=`)

### 🧪 TryHackMe Example (`<=`)

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
    -> FROM books
    -> WHERE published_date <= "2021-11-15";
```

### 🧠 Input Explained

* returns rows where the date is:

  * before 2021-11-15 **or exactly** 2021-11-15

### 📤 Output Explained

* shows books published on or before that date.

---

### 🧪 TryHackMe Example (`>=`)

```sql
mysql> SELECT *
    -> FROM books
    -> WHERE published_date >= "2021-11-02";
```

### 🧠 Input Explained

* returns rows where the date is:

  * after 2021-11-02 **or exactly** 2021-11-02

### 📤 Output Explained

* shows books published on or after that date.

## 🧠 Pentester Takeaway

* Operators are the foundation of filtering logic in apps:

  * Search bars (`LIKE`)
  * Category filters (`=`, `!=`)
  * Date filtering (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
  * Range filters (`BETWEEN`)
  * Multi-condition logic (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`)
* When you test an app, always ask:

  * “What does the backend query probably look like?”
  * “Is user input being inserted into `WHERE` logic unsafely?”
* Most early SQL injection and access-control issues show up around:

  * search endpoints + filters + sorting + pagination

# 🧮 Task 8 — Functions

When working with data, **functions** help us streamline queries and perform operations on data values directly within SQL statements. Functions can manipulate strings, perform calculations, aggregate values, and extract specific data from columns.

From a **pentesting perspective**, SQL functions are important because:

* They are frequently abused during **SQL Injection**
* They allow attackers to **extract metadata**, **bypass filters**, and **reconstruct sensitive data**
* They are often blocked by WAFs — knowing them helps identify **filter weaknesses**

---

## 🔤 String Functions

String functions perform operations on string (text) values and return a processed result.

---

## CONCAT() Function

The `CONCAT()` function is used to **join two or more strings together** into a single string.

### 📌 TryHackMe Example

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(name, ' is a type of ', category, ' book.') AS book_info
FROM books;
```

---

### 🔍 Input Explained (Line by Line)

```sql
SELECT
```

* Tells MySQL we are **retrieving data** from the database.

```sql
CONCAT(name, ' is a type of ', category, ' book.')
```

* Calls the **CONCAT() function**
* Joins:

  * `name` column (book title)
  * A literal string: `' is a type of '`
  * `category` column (e.g., Offensive Security)
  * A literal string: `' book.'`

```sql
AS book_info
```

* Renames the resulting column to **book_info**
* This is an **alias**, making output more readable.

```sql
FROM books;
```

* Specifies the source table: **books**

---

### 📤 Output Explained

Each row returns a single string like:

```
Android Security Internals is a type of Defensive Security book.
```

The output merges **multiple columns + static text** into a readable sentence.

---

### 🧠 Pentester Insight

* `CONCAT()` is frequently used during **data exfiltration**
* Attackers use it to:

  * Combine usernames + passwords
  * Reconstruct table structures
  * Bypass column restrictions in SQLi payloads

---

## GROUP_CONCAT() Function

The `GROUP_CONCAT()` function concatenates values from **multiple rows** into a **single string**.

---

### 📌 TryHackMe Example

```sql
SELECT category, GROUP_CONCAT(name SEPARATOR ', ') AS books
FROM books
GROUP BY category;
```

---

### 🔍 Input Explained

```sql
SELECT category,
```

* Retrieves the `category` column
* This will become the **grouping key**

```sql
GROUP_CONCAT(name SEPARATOR ', ')
```

* Aggregates multiple `name` values
* Combines them into **one string**
* Uses `, ` as the separator between values

```sql
AS books
```

* Aliases the aggregated output column as `books`

```sql
FROM books
```

* Source table

```sql
GROUP BY category;
```

* Groups rows by category
* One row per category in output

---

### 📤 Output Explained

Example result:

```
Offensive Security | Bug Bounty Bootcamp, Car Hacker's Handbook, Ethical Hacking
```

Each category now contains **multiple book titles combined into one field**.

---

### 🧠 Pentester Insight

* `GROUP_CONCAT()` is **extremely powerful in SQL injection**
* Used to:

  * Dump entire tables in **one request**
  * Bypass output size limitations
* Often restricted by WAFs → presence indicates weak filtering

---

## SUBSTRING() Function

The `SUBSTRING()` function extracts a portion of a string, starting at a given position for a specified length.

---

### 📌 TryHackMe Example

```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING(published_date, 1, 4) AS published_year
FROM books;
```

---

### 🔍 Input Explained

```sql
SUBSTRING(published_date, 1, 4)
```

* `published_date` → source column
* `1` → starting position (SQL is **1-indexed**, not 0)
* `4` → number of characters to extract

```sql
AS published_year
```

* Renames output column

---

### 📤 Output Explained

Returns only the **year portion** of the date:

```
2014
2021
2016
```

---

### 🧠 Pentester Insight

* Used to:

  * Extract **password hashes piece by piece**
  * Bypass filters limiting string length
* Common in **blind SQL injection**

---

## LENGTH() Function

The `LENGTH()` function returns the **number of characters** in a string, including spaces.

---

### 📌 TryHackMe Example

```sql
SELECT LENGTH(name) AS name_length
FROM books;
```

---

### 🔍 Input Explained

```sql
LENGTH(name)
```

* Counts characters in the `name` column

```sql
AS name_length
```

* Renames output for clarity

---

### 📤 Output Explained

Each row shows how long the book title is in characters.

---

### 🧠 Pentester Insight

* Used to:

  * Detect password length
  * Perform inference during blind SQLi
* Often combined with `SUBSTRING()`

---

## 📊 Aggregate Functions

## ✅ Task 9 — Conclusion

### 🎯 Conclusion

Congratulations on completing **SQL Fundamentals**!

This room has hopefully taught you the importance of databases in computing. With so many real-world use cases — many of which we interact with daily — understanding database fundamentals is essential for anyone pursuing a career in **cybersecurity**.

Throughout this room, we covered the following key concepts:

- **Databases** are collections of organised data or information that are easily accessible and can be manipulated or analysed.
- The two primary types of databases are:
  - **Relational databases** — used to store structured data in tables.
  - **Non-relational databases** — used to store data in non-tabular formats.
- Relational databases are composed of **tables**, **rows**, and **columns**.
- **Primary keys** ensure that each record within a table is unique.
- **Foreign keys** allow relationships to be created between two (or more) tables.
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)** is an easy-to-learn programming language used to interact with relational databases.
- **Database and Table Statements** are used to create, modify, and manage databases and tables.
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - `INSERT`
  - `SELECT`
  - `UPDATE`
  - `DELETE`  
  are used to manage and manipulate data inside a database.
- **SQL Clauses** allow us to control how data is retrieved, filtered, sorted, and grouped.
- The effective use of **operators** and **functions** enables more precise filtering and manipulation of data.
