# 🟨 JavaScript Essentials

**TryHackMe — Cyber Security 101 → Web Hacking**

---

## 🛠️ Task 1 — Introduction

---

### 📘 Introduction

JavaScript (JS) is a **client-side scripting language** that allows web developers to add **interactivity and dynamic behavior** to websites that are otherwise built using HTML and CSS.

Once HTML elements are created and styled, JavaScript can be used to:

* Validate user input
* Handle button clicks and events
* Display alerts and prompts
* Dynamically update page content
* Perform calculations
* Control logic and flow within the browser

While HTML defines **structure** and CSS defines **appearance**, JavaScript defines **behavior**.

From a security perspective, JavaScript is extremely important because attackers frequently **abuse legitimate JavaScript functionality** to achieve malicious outcomes such as:

* Manipulating logic
* Bypassing controls
* Stealing data
* Triggering unintended application behavior

---

### 🧠 Image Explanation (Conceptual)

**Image shown:**
A laptop with a JavaScript (`JS`) logo on the screen.

**What this image represents conceptually:**
This image emphasizes that JavaScript runs **inside the browser**, on the **user’s machine**, not on the server. This distinction is critical for security because **client-side logic can be inspected, modified, or bypassed by an attacker**.

---

### 🎯 Room Purpose

This room is designed as an **introductory overview of JavaScript**, specifically tailored for:

* Beginners with limited JavaScript experience
* Learners approaching JavaScript from a **cybersecurity and pentesting perspective**

Rather than teaching JavaScript for software development, the focus is on:

* Understanding how JavaScript works
* Recognizing how attackers exploit JavaScript logic
* Identifying insecure JavaScript implementations

---

### 📋 Room Prerequisites

Before starting this room, you should already be familiar with:

* **Linux Fundamentals**
* **Web Application Basics**
* **How Websites Work**

These prerequisites ensure you understand browsers, servers, HTTP, and basic web communication before diving into JavaScript behavior.

---

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this room, you will be able to:

* Understand the **basics of JavaScript**
* Integrate JavaScript into HTML pages
* Identify and abuse **dialogue functions** such as alerts and prompts
* Bypass **control flow statements**
* Explore **minified JavaScript files**
* Understand JavaScript **best practices from a security perspective**

These objectives will be reinforced progressively throughout the tasks.

---

## ✅ Task 1 Status

This task establishes:

* What JavaScript is
* Why it matters for security
* How it fits into the web stack
* How the lab environment works

---

## 🛠️ Task 2 — Essential Concepts

This task introduces **core JavaScript concepts** that are required to understand how client-side logic works in modern web applications. From a security perspective, these concepts are critical because attackers often abuse JavaScript logic to bypass validation, manipulate application flow, or execute malicious behavior.

---

## 📦 Variables

### What Are Variables?

Variables are **containers used to store data values** in memory so they can be reused later in a program.

In JavaScript, every variable:
- Has a **name**
- Holds a **value**
- Can be referenced and modified throughout the script

Think of a variable like a **labeled bucket**:
- The label is the variable name
- The contents are the stored value

---

### Declaring Variables in JavaScript

JavaScript provides **three ways** to declare variables:

```js
var
let
const
````

#### `var`

* Function-scoped
* Older and less secure
* Can be redeclared and reassigned
* Can lead to unexpected behavior due to scope leakage

#### `let`

* Block-scoped
* Can be reassigned but not redeclared in the same scope
* Preferred for values that change

#### `const`

* Block-scoped
* Cannot be reassigned after declaration
* Used for values that should remain constant

---

## 🧬 Data Types

Data types define **what kind of data a variable can store**.

Common JavaScript data types include:

* `string` → Text values

  ```js
  let name = "Alice";
  ```

* `number` → Numeric values

  ```js
  let age = 25;
  ```

* `boolean` → True / False

  ```js
  let isAdmin = false;
  ```

* `null` → Explicitly empty value

* `undefined` → Variable declared but not assigned

* `object` → Complex structures (arrays, objects, JSON)

Understanding data types is essential because:

* User input is often type-dependent
* Type confusion can lead to logic flaws
* Improper handling can enable attacks (e.g., bypassing checks)

---

## 🧠 Functions

### What Is a Function?

A function is a **reusable block of code** designed to perform a specific task.

Functions:

* Reduce repetition
* Improve readability
* Encapsulate logic

---

### Example Function (From Lesson)

```html
<script>
function PrintResult(rollNum) {
  alert("Username with roll number " + rollNum + " has passed the exam");
  // any other logic to display the result
}

for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  PrintResult(rollNumbers[i]);
}
</script>
```

---

### Explanation

* `PrintResult(rollNum)` defines a function
* `rollNum` is an **argument**
* The function displays an alert message
* A `for` loop calls the function multiple times

Instead of writing the same alert 100 times, the function is reused.

---

### 🖼️ Image Explained — Function Execution

The image visually demonstrates:

* One function definition
* Multiple calls to the same function
* How loops and functions work together

This is critical for pentesters because:

* Client-side functions often enforce validation
* Attackers look for ways to bypass or alter function behavior

---

## 🔁 Loops

Loops allow you to **run a block of code multiple times** as long as a condition remains `true`.
They are commonly used to repeat tasks, such as iterating over lists, processing user input, or executing the same logic for multiple records.

In JavaScript, the most common loops are:

* `for`
* `while`
* `do...while`

---

### Why Loops Matter (Conceptually)

Without loops, repetitive tasks would require writing the same line of code over and over again, which is inefficient and error-prone.

For example, if we wanted to display the exam results of **100 students**, we could:

* Call the same function **100 separate times** (bad practice), **or**
* Use a loop to call the function automatically for each student (correct approach)

---

### Building on the Function Example

Earlier, we defined a function to print a student’s result:

```javascript
// Function to print student result
function PrintResult(rollNum) {
    alert("Username with roll number " + rollNum + " has passed the exam");
    // any other logic to display the result
}
```

This function works for **one student**, but what if we have **many students**?

---

### Using a `for` Loop to Repeat the Function Call

Instead of calling `PrintResult()` manually 100 times, we use a loop:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    PrintResult(rollNumbers[i]); // this will be called 100 times
}
```

#### What’s happening here:

* `let i = 0`
  Initializes a counter variable

* `i < 100`
  Sets the loop condition (runs while true)

* `i++`
  Increments the counter after each iteration

* `PrintResult(rollNumbers[i])`
  Calls the function once per iteration, passing in the current roll number

This loop executes **100 times**, automatically calling the function for each student.

---

### Why This Is Important for Security

From a security and pentesting perspective, loops are important because:

* Loops can process **user-controlled input repeatedly**
* Improper validation inside loops can lead to:

  * Logic flaws
  * Infinite loops (Denial of Service)
  * Mass execution of unintended actions
* Attackers often exploit loops combined with weak conditions

Understanding how loops work helps you identify **where code repeats and how it can be abused**.

### Loop Types at a Glance

| Loop Type    | Description                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `for`        | Best for known iteration counts              |
| `while`      | Runs while a condition is true               |
| `do...while` | Runs at least once before checking condition |

## 🌐 Request–Response Cycle

### What Is the Request–Response Cycle?

The **request–response cycle** describes how a web application communicates:

1. The **browser (client)** sends a request
2. The **web server** processes it
3. The **server responds** with data

This could be:

* HTML
* JavaScript
* JSON
* API responses

---

### Why This Matters for JavaScript

JavaScript:

* Executes in the browser
* Handles user interactions
* Often processes server responses

Attackers exploit JavaScript to:

* Modify requests
* Alter responses
* Inject malicious behavior

Understanding this cycle is **fundamental to web hacking**.
