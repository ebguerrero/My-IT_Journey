# Cryptography: The Basics

Learn the foundations of **cryptography**, including encryption, ciphers, and the mathematical concepts that secure modern communications.

## Task 1: Introduction

Cryptography is the science of protecting information from unauthorized access or alteration. It ensures that communication remains **confidential**, **authentic**, and **integral** even when transmitted over untrusted networks.

Thanks to cryptography:
- We can send private messages without others reading them.
- Our web sessions (HTTPS) are encrypted.
- We can verify file integrity and confirm we’re talking to legitimate servers.

**Learning Objectives**
- Understand key cryptographic terms.
- Learn why cryptography is important.
- Explore classical and modern encryption methods.
- Practice basic math used in cryptographic systems.

✅ *Answer:* I’m ready to start learning about cryptography!

## Task 2: Importance of Cryptography

Cryptography provides **secure communication in the presence of adversaries**. It’s the mechanism that guarantees:
- **Confidentiality** — no one can read private data.
- **Integrity** — no one can modify the data undetected.
- **Authenticity** — you know who you’re communicating with.

**Common uses:**
- Logging into a website (credentials encrypted in transit).
- Establishing an SSH session.
- Online banking sessions verified via server certificates.
- Checking file integrity via hash values.

Cryptography also underpins major compliance standards:
- **PCI DSS** — protects credit card data.
- **HIPAA / HITECH** — protects medical records in the U.S.
- **GDPR / DPA** — regulates personal data in Europe and the UK.

✅ *Answer:* `PCI DSS`

## Task 3: Plaintext to Ciphertext

The basic flow of encryption:

```

Plaintext → [Encrypt + Key] → Ciphertext
Ciphertext → [Decrypt + Key] → Plaintext

```

**Key Terms**
- **Plaintext:** Readable message or data before encryption.  
- **Ciphertext:** Scrambled message after encryption.  
- **Cipher:** The algorithm or method that performs encryption/decryption.  
- **Key:** The secret or unique value controlling how encryption/decryption happens.  
- **Encryption:** The process of converting plaintext to ciphertext using a cipher and key.  
- **Decryption:** The process of reverting ciphertext back to plaintext.

✅ *Answer:* Encrypted plaintext is called **ciphertext**  
✅ *Answer:* The process that returns plaintext is **decryption**

## Task 4: Historical Ciphers

One of the earliest ciphers was the **Caesar Cipher**, dating back to ancient Rome.  
It works by shifting each letter by a fixed number (key) in the alphabet.

**Example**
- Plaintext: `TRYHACKME`  
- Key: `3` (right shift)  
- Ciphertext: `WUBKDFNPH`

**Decryption reverses** the shift — if the encryption shifts right by 3, decryption shifts left by 3.

```

A → D → G → J
B → E → H → K
...

```

Since there are only 25 possible shifts, this cipher is easy to break by brute force.

✅ *Answer:* Decrypting `XRPCTCRGNEI` (key=5) → `ICANENCRYPT`

## Task 5: Types of Encryption

There are two main types of encryption: **symmetric** and **asymmetric**.

### Symmetric Encryption (Private-Key)
- Uses **the same key** to encrypt and decrypt.  
- Fast and efficient but requires secure key exchange.  
- Examples:  
  - **DES** (Data Encryption Standard) — now obsolete.  
  - **3DES** (Triple DES) — more secure but deprecated.  
  - **AES** (Advanced Encryption Standard) — modern replacement.

✅ *Answer:* Should you trust DES? → **Nay**  
✅ *Answer:* AES adopted in **2001**

### Asymmetric Encryption (Public-Key)
- Uses a **pair of keys**:  
  - **Public key** to encrypt data.  
  - **Private key** to decrypt data.  
- Solves the key-sharing problem.  
- Common algorithms: **RSA**, **Diffie–Hellman**, **ECC**.  
- Slower but more secure for authentication and key exchange.

**Summary**
| Type | Key Usage | Examples |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Symmetric | Same key for both sides | AES, DES |
| Asymmetric | Public/private pair | RSA, ECC |

## Task 6: Basic Math in Cryptography

Mathematics is the backbone of all cryptographic systems.  
Two essential concepts: **XOR (exclusive OR)** and **Modulo arithmetic**.

### XOR (⊕)
Used widely in encryption and error detection.

**Truth Table**
```

A  B | A ⊕ B
0  0 | 0
0  1 | 1
1  0 | 1
1  1 | 0

```

**Properties**
- `A ⊕ 0 = A`
- `A ⊕ A = 0`
- `(A ⊕ B) ⊕ C = A ⊕ (B ⊕ C)`

**Simple Example**
```

1001 ⊕ 1010 = 0011

```

✅ *Answer:* 1001 ⊕ 1010 = **0011**

### Modulo Operation (%)
Modulo gives the **remainder** when dividing one number by another.  
Written as `A % B`.

**Examples**
```

25 % 5 = 0   → (25 ÷ 5 = 5 remainder 0)
23 % 6 = 5   → (23 ÷ 6 = 3 remainder 5)
23 % 7 = 2   → (23 ÷ 7 = 3 remainder 2)

```

✅ *Answer:* 118613842 % 9091 = **3565**  
✅ *Answer:* 60 % 12 = **0**

**Why it matters:**  
Modulo arithmetic provides the “wrap-around” behavior used in many cryptographic systems, such as key schedules and elliptic curve operations.

- **Purpose:** Protect data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.  
- **Core Concepts:** Plaintext, Ciphertext, Cipher, Key, Encryption, Decryption.
