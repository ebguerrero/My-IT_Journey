# 🧰 Nmap Default Scripts Cheat Sheet (`-sC`)

The `-sC` flag tells Nmap to run its **default NSE script set**, which performs safe, lightweight enumeration across multiple protocols.

These scripts are designed to collect **information**, **metadata**, and **non-intrusive vulnerability indicators** without causing instability.

---

## 🏴 1. Banner Grabbing

**Purpose:** Identify services and versions based on connection greetings.

**What Nmap does:**

* Connects to ports
* Reads any banner text returned
* Parses service names and versions

**Example banner:**

```
220 ProFTPD 1.3.5a Server ready.
```

**Why it matters:**

* Quick fingerprinting
* Early detection of vulnerable versions
* Huge recon value with minimal noise

---

## 🔢 2. Version Detection (`-sV`) Enhancement

While `-sV` is the main version detection flag, `-sC` adds scripts that:

* Probe services for more detailed version info
* Validate responses against Nmap's version DB
* Extract OS hints, frameworks, and stack versions

**Examples of what Nmap may detect:**

* Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
* OpenSSH 7.2p2
* Samba 3.0.20

---

## 🧪 3. Basic Vulnerability Checks

Default scripts run **safe** vulnerability tests (non-exploitative).

**They check for:**

* Misconfigurations
* Weak default settings
* Known but safe-to-test CVEs
* Anonymous logins
* Old/insecure protocol versions

**Examples:**

* FTP anonymous login
* HTTP directory listing
* SMB signing disabled
* SSL/TLS protocol weakness indicators

---

## 📁 4. SMB Enumeration

If SMB ports (139, 445) are open, default scripts can pull:

* Host OS & version
* Workgroup/domain
* NetBIOS/SMB names
* SMB signing status
* Public shares
* Anonymous access capability

**Why it matters:**

* SMB is a *treasure trove* for Windows attacks
* Great for lateral movement reconnaissance

---

## 🌐 5. HTTP Service Enumeration

If port 80/443/8080/etc. is open, default scripts collect:

### **HTTP Headers**

* `Server:` (Apache, Nginx, IIS)
* `X-Powered-By:` (PHP, ASP.NET)
* Cookie attributes
* Content types
* Security headers (or missing ones)

### **Behavioral Indicators**

* Status codes
* Redirects
* Known pages

**Why it's useful:**

* Reveals framework info
* Shows security posture
* Helps identify attack surface

---

## 🔐 6. SSL/TLS Certificate Checks

Default HTTPS scripts extract:

* SSL certificate
* Expiry dates
* Issuer
* CN/SAN fields
* Self-signed or not
* Key size & algorithm
* Protocol versions supported

**Why it matters:**

* Old TLS versions = weak crypto
* Self-signed certs expose internal hostnames
* Useful for phishing, MITM, and recon

---

## 🗂 7. Miscellaneous Protocol Checks

Default scripts also lightly inspect:

* DNS (version, recursion, zone transfers)
* SMTP (VRFY/EXPN tests, banner)
* SSH algorithms
* Telnet prompts
* RPC endpoints
* NFS exports

Nmap automatically picks the correct scripts based on detected services.

# 🧨 TL;DR (For Interviews & Notes)

> **Nmap’s default scripts perform safe reconnaissance across all detected services — grabbing banners, identifying versions, checking basic vulnerabilities, inspecting SMB and HTTP behavior, and evaluating SSL/TLS security.**

This gives you **immediate intelligence** without being noisy or intrusive.
