# CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)

This section documents my **Security+** journey and outcomes.  
I’m not publishing third-party course materials; instead this page summarizes **how I studied**, **what I learned**, and **how to verify my certification**.

---

## 📚 Study Approach
- Primary materials: **Dion Training** (videos + study guide).
- Then I did **deep-dive research** for each topic:
  - Searched the web, read docs/blogs/whitepapers, and watched YouTube until concepts were clear.
  - Focused on **understanding**, not memorization — I verified I could explain ideas in my own words.
- Passing Security+ is only the start; the real test is retaining the knowledge in such a broad field without daily application. I suggest taking a chapter once a week and studying it again.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways
- **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) is the core lens for evaluating controls.  
- **AAA** (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) underpins identity and access management.  
- **Risk basics:** Risk ≈ Threat × Vulnerability × Impact; treat via Avoid/Accept/Transfer/Mitigate.  
- **Zero Trust:** “Never trust, always verify.” Enforce least privilege and continuous evaluation.  
- **Threats:** Social engineering, malware, insider threats, organized crime, and nation-state actors.  
- **Controls:** Preventive, Detective, Corrective, Deterrent, Compensating, and Physical controls.  
- **Crypto basics:** Hashing vs. encryption, symmetric vs. asymmetric, PKI, digital signatures.  
- **Incident response:** Prep → ID → Contain → Eradicate → Recover → Lessons Learned.

## 📝 Notes
My long-form, hands-on notes live elsewhere in this repo (e.g., TryHackMe tracks).  
For Security+, I kept it **conceptual** — learning by researching and explaining, not copying a textbook.
