# CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)

This section documents my **Security+** journey and outcomes.  
I’m not publishing third-party course materials; instead this page summarizes **how I studied**, **what I learned**, and **how to verify my certification**.

---

## 📚 Study Approach
- Primary materials: **Dion Training** (videos + study guide).
- Then I did **deep-dive research** for each topic:
  - Searched the web, read docs/blogs/whitepapers, and watched YouTube until concepts were clear.
  - Focused on **understanding**, not memorization — I verified I could explain ideas in my own words.
- Passing Security+ is only the start; the real test is retaining the knowledge in such a broad field without daily application. I suggest taking a chapter once a week and studying it again.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways from Security+ (SY0-701)

- **Core Principles** → CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) is the foundation of security; layered with AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting).  
- **Risk & Governance** → Risk ≈ Threat × Vulnerability × Impact; organizations manage risk through policies, frameworks (NIST, ISO), and treatments (Avoid, Accept, Transfer, Mitigate).  
- **Zero Trust** → “Never trust, always verify.” Identity, least privilege, and continuous monitoring are mandatory in modern networks.  
- **Threat Landscape** → Social engineering, malware, ransomware, insider misuse, organized crime, hacktivists, and nation-state Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).  
- **Security Controls** → Preventive, Detective, Corrective, Deterrent, Compensating, Physical; aligned to Technical, Managerial, and Operational categories.  
- **Cryptography** → Hashing vs. encryption, symmetric vs. asymmetric, PKI, digital certificates, TLS, and digital signatures to ensure integrity and trust.  
- **Identity & Access Management** → MFA, SSO, federation, LDAP/Active Directory, biometrics, and cloud IAM models.  
- **Network & Host Security** → Firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPNs, segmentation, endpoint detection/response (EDR), patch management, and secure protocols.  
- **Incident Response & Forensics** → Phases: Preparation → Identification → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned; evidence integrity and chain of custody.  
- **Business Continuity & Resilience** → Backups, redundancy, disaster recovery (RTO/RPO), fault tolerance, and high availability to ensure uptime.

## 📝 Notes
My long-form, hands-on notes live elsewhere in this repo (e.g., TryHackMe tracks).  
For Security+, I kept it **conceptual** — learning by researching and explaining, not copying a textbook.
