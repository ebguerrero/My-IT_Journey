# 04 — Social Engineering

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Recognize psychological triggers used in attacks.  
- Understand types of impersonation and fraud.  
- Identify phishing techniques and mitigations.  

---

## Task 1 – Psychology of Attacks
- **Authority** → attacker pretends to be someone in charge.  
- **Urgency** → creates pressure to act quickly.  
- **Social proof** → “others are doing it” manipulation.  
- **Scarcity** → limited availability to pressure a decision.  
- **Likability** → building rapport to lower defenses.  
- **Fear** → using threats to force compliance.  

---

## Task 2 – Impersonation Tactics
- **Impersonation**: attacker poses as a trusted person.  
- **Brand impersonation**: fake websites or logos.  
- **Typosquatting**: domain names close to real ones.  
- **Watering hole attack**: compromising sites a target often visits.  
- **Pretexting**: using a partly true story to make a false scenario more believable.  

---

## Task 3 – Phishing Family
- **Phishing** → mass emails to many users.  
- **Spear phishing** → targeted to one person.  
- **Whaling** → targeted at executives.  
- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)** → compromise of a trusted business account.  
- **Vishing** → voice phishing.  
- **Smishing** → SMS/text phishing.  

---

## Task 4 – Other Social Attacks
- **Identity theft/fraud** → stealing personal info for gain.  
- **Invoice scams** → fake payment requests.  
- **Misinformation vs Disinformation** → unintentional vs intentional falsehoods.  
- **Dumpster diving** → recovering sensitive data from trash.  
- **Shoulder surfing** → looking over someone’s shoulder.  
- **Baiting** → leaving infected media for someone to pick up.
