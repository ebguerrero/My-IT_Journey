## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
- Recognize social-engineering triggers and attack types.  
- Identify phishing forms and BEC (business email compromise).  
- Learn basic defenses and user-awareness controls.

---

## Task 1 â€” Psychology & Triggers
- Common triggers: **Authority**, **Urgency**, **Scarcity**, **Social proof**, **Fear**, **Reciprocity**.  
- Attackers craft plausible pretexts to exploit these triggers.

## Task 3 â€” Impersonation & Info Gathering
- **Pretexting**: build a believable story (call, email).  
- **Watering hole**: compromise a site frequented by targets.  
- **Dumpster diving** & shoulder surfing: physical info theft.

---

## Task 4 â€” Defenses
- Security awareness training, simulated phishing, DMARC/SPF/DKIM email controls, MFA, escalation/escrow processes for financial requests.

---

## Key Terms
- BEC, whaling, spear phishing, pretexting, typosquatting, water-holing

---

## Practice Prompts
- Create 5 quick phishing indicators to include in staff training.  
- Describe one technical control and one human control to mitigate BEC.
