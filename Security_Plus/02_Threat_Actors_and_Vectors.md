# 02 — Threat Actors and Vectors

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Identify different types of **threat actors** and their motivations.  
- Define **threat vectors** (attack methods) and **attack surfaces**.  
- Recognize deception techniques like **honeypots** and **honeyfiles**.  

---

## Task 1 – Types of Threat Actors
- **Script kiddies** → Unskilled attackers using pre-made tools; usually motivated by curiosity or mischief.  
- **Hacktivists** → Attack for ideological or political reasons (cause-driven).  
- **Organized crime groups** → Sophisticated, financially motivated; often behind ransomware.  
- **Nation-state / Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)** → Well-funded, long-term campaigns targeting governments or critical industries.  
- **Insiders** → Employees or contractors with inside access, whether malicious, negligent, or compromised.  

**Motivations**: financial gain, espionage, revenge, ideological goals, or disruption.

## Task 2 – Threat Vectors
- **Threat vector** = how an attack happens. Examples:  
  - Phishing emails.  
  - Malicious websites or drive-by downloads.  
  - Removable media (infected USB).  
  - Wireless connections (rogue Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).  
  - Insider misuse.  

- **Attack surface** = total set of possible entry points.  
  - Reduce by: disabling unused services, enforcing patching, limiting accounts.

## Task 3 – Deception and Disruption
- **Honeypot** → fake system designed to lure attackers.  
- **Honeynet** → network of honeypots.  
- **Honeyfiles/tokens** → fake documents/credentials used to detect intrusions.  
- **Deception tools** waste attackers’ time and provide defenders with intelligence.

## 💡 Practice Prompts
- Compare **hacktivists** and **nation-state actors**.  
- List three examples of **threat vectors**.  
- Explain how a **honeypot** can help defenders.
