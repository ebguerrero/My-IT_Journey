# 02 — Threat Actors & Vectors

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Identify common threat actors and their motivations.  
- Explain **threat vectors** vs. **attack surfaces**.  
- Recognize deception technologies.

---

## Task 1 – Who Attacks?
- **Script Kiddies** → Low-skill attackers using premade tools.  
- **Hacktivists** → Politically/ideologically motivated.  
- **Organized Crime** → Profit-driven, professionalized (fraud, ransomware).  
- **Nation-State/APT** → Highly skilled, long-term espionage or disruption.  
- **Insiders** → Malicious, negligent, or compromised employees/contractors.

**Motivations:** money, ideology, espionage, reputation damage, sabotage.

---

## Task 2 – Threat Vectors & Attack Surface
- **Vector** = “How the attack happens” (phishing, USB drops, Wi-Fi exploits).  
- **Attack Surface** = “Where the attack can hit” (network ports, exposed apps, physical doors).  
- Reduce surface area by removing unused software/services, applying least privilege, disabling old protocols.

---

## Task 3 – Deception & Disruption
- **Honeypots/Honeynets** = decoy systems to trap attackers.  
- **Honeyfiles/Honeytokens** = fake credentials/files to detect access attempts.  
- **Bogus DNS/decoy services** to confuse attackers.  
- **Spoofed telemetry** to waste attacker time.

## Key Terms
TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures), Honeypot, Insider Threat, Attack Surface

---

## Practice Prompts
- Give 3 motivations for nation-state attackers.  
- Contrast vector vs. surface with an example.  
- What is a honeypot and how is it used?
