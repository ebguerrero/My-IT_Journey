# 02 – Threat Actors & Vectors

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Identify **types of threat actors**, their motivations, and sophistication.
- Explain **threat vectors** and **attack surfaces**.
- Understand **deception technologies** like honeypots.

---

## Types of Threat Actors
- **Script Kiddies** → low skill, use pre-made tools.
- **Hacktivists** → politically/ideologically motivated.
- **Organized Crime** → profit-driven (fraud, ransomware).
- **Nation-state/APT** → well-resourced, strategic, long dwell time.
- **Insiders** → malicious, negligent, or compromised employees/contractors.

**Motives**: financial gain, espionage, disruption, revenge, ideology, warfare.

---

## Threat Vectors
- **Email, SMS, Web, Images, Files, Removable Media**
- **Wireless** (insecure Wi-Fi, Bluetooth)
- **Physical** access
- **Supply chain** compromises

**Attack Surface** = total possible entry/exit points.  
→ Minimize by disabling unused services, restricting access, hardening configs.

---

## Deception & Disruption
- **Honeypots/Honeynets** → lure attackers, log actions.
- **Honeyfiles/Tokens** → fake sensitive data.
- **Bogus DNS entries** / decoy directories.
- **Spoofed telemetry** or false flags.

## 📝 Key Terms
APT, Insider Threat, Threat Vector, Attack Surface, Honeypot, Honeyfile

---

## 🧩 Practice Prompts
- Compare threat actor motivations for hacktivists vs nation-states.  
- Define the difference between a **vector** and **attack surface**.  
- What role does a honeypot play in defense?
