# 05 – Malware

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Identify categories of malware.  
- Explain **fileless/multi-stage** malware.  
- Recognize common indicators of compromise.

---

## Malware Types
- **Virus** → needs user action.  
- **Worm** → self-replicating.  
- **Trojan** → disguised as legit software.  
- **Ransomware** → encrypts files for ransom.  
- **Spyware/Adware** → monitors user activity.  
- **Rootkit** → kernel-level stealth.  
- **Botnet/Zombies** → controlled by C2 server.  

---

## Advanced Types
- **Fileless malware** → runs in memory using system tools (LOLbins).  
- **Multi-stage attacks** → dropper → downloader → RAT/C2 → actions on objectives.  
- **Logic bombs** → trigger under specific conditions.  
- **Keyloggers** → record keystrokes.

## Indicators of Compromise
- Unexplained account lockouts.  
- Concurrent logins.  
- Impossible travel activity.  
- Missing logs or abnormal resource usage.  

---

## Defenses
- Patch/update systems.  
- Use EDR/AV.  
- Apply least privilege + MFA.  
- Incident playbooks (e.g., ransomware = isolate, report, restore from backups).
