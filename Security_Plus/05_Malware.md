# 05 — Malware

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Differentiate major malware types.  
- Recognize botnets, backdoors, logic bombs, and keyloggers.  
- Identify fileless and multi-stage malware.

---

## Task 1 – Malware Categories
- **Virus** → Needs user action.  
- **Worm** → Self-spreading.  
- **Trojan** → Masquerades as legit software.  
- **Ransomware** → Encrypts, demands ransom.  
- **Spyware** → Gathers info secretly.  
- **Rootkit** → Deep privilege hiding.  
- **Adware/Spam** → Annoyance, monetization.

---

## Task 2 – Modern Malware
- **Fileless Malware** → Runs in memory, uses system tools.  
- **Multi-Stage Attacks** → Dropper → Downloader → Payload.  
- **Botnets** → Large network of compromised devices (“zombies”).  
- **Command & Control (C2)** → Server controlling botnet.  
- **Keyloggers** → Capture keystrokes, software or hardware based.

---

## Task 3 – Indicators
- Strange logins, multiple locations.  
- Slow systems, high CPU usage.  
- Logs missing/altered.  
- Out-of-cycle events like midnight logins.

---

## Task 4 – Defenses
- Patch systems, update AV/EDR.  
- Apply principle of least privilege.  
- Strong backup/recovery plans.  
- Train users to avoid malicious links/attachments.

---

## Key Terms
Virus, Worm, Trojan, Ransomware, Fileless Malware, Botnet, C2, Rootkit, Keylogger

---

## Practice Prompts
- Differentiate a virus vs. a worm.  
- What is a fileless attack and how is it detected?  
- Sketch a two-stage malware chain.
