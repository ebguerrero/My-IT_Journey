# 05 â€” Malware

Types of malware, delivery, lifecycle, and defenses.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
- Differentiate virus, worm, trojan, ransomware, rootkit, fileless.  
- Understand stages of infection and common indicators.  
- Know primary defensive measures.

---

## Task 1 â€” Malware Types
- **Virus** â€” requires user action to propagate.  
- **Worm** â€” self-replicates across networks.  
- **Trojan** â€” masquerades as legitimate software.  
- **Ransomware** â€” encrypts data for ransom.  
- **Rootkit** â€” kernel-level stealth; hard to detect.

---

## Task 2 â€” Modern Delivery & Fileless
- **Fileless** attacks run in memory via PowerShell, WMI, living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins).  
- Typical chain: **dropper** â†’ **downloader** â†’ **payload (RAT/C2)** â†’ data exfiltration.

---

## Task 3 â€” Indicators & Detection
- Unexpected processes/connections, high CPU/disk use, odd account activity, new services, missing logs, network beaconing to C2.

---

## Task 4 â€” Defenses & Response
- EDR/AV, patching, least privilege, network segmentation, offline backups, incident playbooks (isolate, preserve logs, restore).

---

## Key Terms
- RAT, C2, fileless, LOLBins, polymorphic, metamorphic, IOC (Indicator of Compromise)

---

## Practice Prompts
- Compare virus vs worm, and name the best control for each.  
- Sketch a two-stage malware chain and state one detection point.
