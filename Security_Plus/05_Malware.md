# 05 — Malware

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Distinguish between viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware.  
- Recognize spyware, rootkits, and keyloggers.  
- Understand botnets, command-and-control, and fileless malware.  

---

## Task 1 – Malware Categories
- **Virus** → requires user action to spread (opening file).  
- **Worm** → self-replicates without user action.  
- **Trojan Horse** → appears legitimate but carries malicious code.  
- **Ransomware** → encrypts files, demands payment.  
- **Spyware** → secretly collects user data.  
- **Rootkit** → hides attacker presence at the operating system level.  
- **Keylogger** → records keystrokes (software or hardware).  

---

## Task 2 – Advanced Types
- **Botnet** → group of compromised devices (zombies) under attacker control.  
- **Command-and-Control (C2)** → attacker infrastructure managing the botnet.  
- **Logic Bomb** → code triggered by a specific event.  
- **Fileless Malware** → runs in memory, uses legitimate tools (like PowerShell).  

---

## Task 3 – Malware Delivery
- **Droppers/Downloaders** → small programs that install larger payloads.  
- **Polymorphic Malware** → constantly changes its code to evade detection.  
- **Metamorphic Malware** → rewrites itself with each infection.  

---

## Task 4 – Indicators of Infection
- Unusual account lockouts.  
- Slow system performance.  
- Unauthorized processes.  
- Missing or altered logs.  
- Unexpected outbound traffic.  

---

## Task 5 – Defenses
- Regular patching/updates.  
- Antivirus/EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response).  
- Least privilege enforcement.  
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA).  
- User awareness training.  
- Incident playbooks (e.g., ransomware → isolate, report, restore backups).  

---

## 📝 Key Terms
- **Trojan Horse**  
- **Rootkit**  
- **Fileless Malware**  
- **Command-and-Control (C2)**  
- **Polymorphic vs Metamorphic Malware**  

---

## 💡 Practice Prompts
- Contrast **virus vs worm** and describe how each spreads.  
- Define **fileless malware** and give one detection method.  
- Explain the role of **command-and-control** in a botnet.
