# 01 — Fundamentals of Security

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Differentiate between **security controls** (categories vs. types).  
- Explain the **CIA triad**, **AAA**, and **non-repudiation**.  
- Summarize **Zero Trust** and basic security principles.  
- Define **threats, vulnerabilities, and risk**.

## Task 1 – Core Concepts
- **Information Security** = protecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.  
- **CIA Triad**:  
  - **Confidentiality** → Prevent unauthorized disclosure (encryption, access controls).  
  - **Integrity** → Ensure data accuracy/consistency (hashing, digital signatures).  
  - **Availability** → Systems/data are accessible when needed (redundancy, backups).  
- **Non-repudiation** → Ensure proof of origin (digital signatures/logging).  
- **AAA** → Authentication (prove identity), Authorization (what user can do), Accounting (audit/log actions).

## Task 2 – Security Controls
**Categories (where control is applied):**
- **Technical**: hardware/software (firewalls, IDS, encryption).  
- **Managerial**: policies, governance, risk management.  
- **Operational**: day-to-day processes (change mgmt, training).  
- **Physical**: locks, barriers, guards, lighting.

**Types (intent of the control):**
- **Preventive** → Stop an incident (firewall, patching).  
- **Detective** → Identify an incident (IDS, logs).  
- **Corrective** → Fix issue post-incident (restore from backup).  
- **Deterrent** → Discourage attacks (warning signs, camera domes).  
- **Compensating** → Alternate safeguard when primary isn’t feasible.  
- **Directive** → Define expected behavior (policies, SOPs).

---

## Task 3 – Threats, Vulnerabilities, Risk
- **Threat** = something with potential to cause harm.  
- **Vulnerability** = weakness or flaw.  
- **Risk** = likelihood × impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.  
  - No vulnerability or no threat = no risk.

---

## Task 4 – Zero Trust
- Principle = “Never trust, always verify.”  
- Every request revalidated, least-privileged access enforced.  
- **Control plane** = policy decisions, identity, monitoring.  
- **Data plane** = systems/transactions where controls are applied.

---

## Key Terms
CIA, AAA, Non-repudiation, Zero Trust, Least Privilege, Separation of Duties

---

## Practice Prompts
- Explain the CIA triad with an example for each.  
- List 4 categories of security controls and give one example.  
- Contrast **threat** vs. **vulnerability** vs. **risk**.
