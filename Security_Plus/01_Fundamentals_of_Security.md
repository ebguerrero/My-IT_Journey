# 01 â€” Fundamentals of Security

Learn the core ideas that underlie all other Security+ topics (CIA, AAA, controls, risk).

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
- Explain the **CIA triad** and **non-repudiation**.  
- Describe **AAA** (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting).  
- Compare **control categories** and **control types**.  
- Define **risk**, **threat**, and **vulnerability**.

---

## Task 1 â€” Core Concepts
- **Information Security**: Protecting confidentiality, integrity, availability of information.  
- **CIA triad**:
  - **Confidentiality** â€” keep data secret (encryption, ACLs).  
  - **Integrity** â€” data unaltered (hashing, signing).  
  - **Availability** â€” services/data available when needed (redundancy, backups).
- **Non-repudiation**: Proof that an action originated from a particular entity (digital signatures, audited logs).

---

## Task 2 â€” AAA & Identity
- **Authentication** â€” verify identity (passwords, MFA, certificates).  
- **Authorization** â€” permissions / access control (RBAC, ABAC).  
- **Accounting** â€” logging and audit trails (SIEM ingestion).

---

## Task 3 â€” Controls (Categories & Types)
- **Categories**:
  - **Technical** â€” firewalls, EDR, encryption.
  - **Managerial** â€” policies, risk assessments.
  - **Operational** â€” procedures, awareness training.
  - **Physical** â€” locks, CCTV, guards.
- **Types**:
  - **Preventive** â€” block events (firewall).
  - **Detective** â€” find events (IDS, SIEM).
  - **Corrective** â€” remediate (patching).
  - **Deterrent / Compensating / Directive** â€” policy signs, alternative measures, rules.

---

## Task 4 â€” Risk vs Threat vs Vulnerability
- **Threat**: potential event/actor causing harm.  
- **Vulnerability**: weakness that can be exploited.  
- **Risk**: the likelihood and impact when a threat leverages a vulnerability.  
- **Risk formula (concept)**: Risk = Likelihood Ã— Impact.

---

## Key Terms
- CIA, AAA, MFA, RBAC, ABAC, Hash, Digital signature, Non-repudiation, Residual risk

---

## Practice Prompts
- Define **integrity** and list two mechanisms that enforce it.  
- Give one **preventive**, one **detective**, and one **corrective** control.  
- Explain how **authorization** differs from **authentication**.
