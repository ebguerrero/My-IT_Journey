# 01 – Fundamentals of Security

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Compare and contrast **security control categories** and **control types**.
- Explain **CIA Triad** and supporting concepts (Non-repudiation, AAA).
- Define **risk, threats, vulnerabilities**, and **Zero Trust**.

---

## Core Concepts
- **Information Security**: protection of data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.  
- **CIA Triad**:
  - **Confidentiality** → keeping data secret (e.g., encryption).
  - **Integrity** → ensuring data is accurate/unaltered (e.g., hashing).
  - **Availability** → ensuring systems/data are available (e.g., redundancy, backups).
- **Non-repudiation**: cannot deny sending/receiving (e.g., digital signatures).
- **AAA**: Authentication, Authorization, Accounting.

## Security Controls
- **Categories**:
  - **Managerial** → policies, governance, risk mgmt.
  - **Operational** → processes, awareness, incident response.
  - **Technical** → software/hardware (firewalls, EDR, encryption).
  - **Physical** → locks, fences, guards.
- **Types**:
  - Preventive
  - Detective
  - Corrective
  - Deterrent
  - Compensating
  - Directive  

💡 **Tip**: Category = who/where, Type = what it does.

## Risk, Threat, Vulnerability
- **Threat** → potential cause of harm.
- **Vulnerability** → weakness exploitable by a threat.
- **Risk** = Threat × Vulnerability.  
  → If one is missing, risk ≈ 0.

## Zero Trust
Principle: **“Never trust, always verify.”**  
- **Control plane**: authentication, policy engines, secure zones.  
- **Data plane**: subjects, enforcement points, continuous validation.

## 📝 Key Terms
CIA, Non-repudiation, AAA, Zero Trust, Policy Engine, PEP, Preventive/Detective controls

## 🧩 Practice Prompts
- Give examples of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability controls.  
- List the 4 categories of controls with one example each.  
- Define risk in terms of threat and vulnerability.
