# 08 — Risk Management

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Define risk and explain risk management strategies.  
- Recognize qualitative vs quantitative risk assessments.  
- Apply risk responses: avoid, transfer, mitigate, accept.  

---

## Task 1 – Risk Formula
- **Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact**.  
- Helps organizations prioritize where to focus resources.  

---

## Task 2 – Risk Assessments
- **Qualitative** → subjective (e.g., high/medium/low risk).  
- **Quantitative** → numerical, uses metrics like ALE (Annual Loss Expectancy).  
  - **SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)** = Asset Value × Exposure Factor.  
  - **ARO (Annual Rate of Occurrence)** = how often it happens yearly.  
  - **ALE (Annual Loss Expectancy)** = SLE × ARO.  

---

## Task 3 – Risk Responses
- **Avoid** → eliminate activity causing risk.  
- **Transfer** → shift risk elsewhere (e.g., insurance).  
- **Mitigate** → implement controls to reduce risk.  
- **Accept** → acknowledge and tolerate the risk.  

---

## Task 4 – Risk Register
- Document listing identified risks, severity, mitigation plans, and owners.  

---

## 📝 Key Terms
- **ALE, SLE, ARO**  
- **Risk Register**  
- **Mitigation vs Transfer**  

---

## 💡 Practice Prompts
- Calculate ALE if asset = $100k, exposure factor = 0.5, ARO = 2.  
- Compare qualitative vs quantitative assessments.  
- Give one example of **risk avoidance**.
