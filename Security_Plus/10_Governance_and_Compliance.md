# 10 — Governance and Compliance

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Define governance, compliance, and their importance.  
- Recognize key regulatory frameworks.  
- Apply policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines.  

---

## Task 1 – Governance vs Compliance
- **Governance** → internal management of security (policies, controls, accountability).  
- **Compliance** → meeting external requirements (laws, regulations, industry standards).  

---

## Task 2 – Policies, Standards, Procedures
- **Policies** → high-level rules (e.g., “All devices must use encryption”).  
- **Standards** → specific requirements (e.g., AES-256 for encryption).  
- **Procedures** → step-by-step instructions.  
- **Guidelines** → recommended best practices.  

---

## Task 3 – Regulations & Frameworks
- **HIPAA** → healthcare data.  
- **PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)** → credit card protection.  
- **SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)** → corporate financial accountability.  
- **ISO 27001** → international information security standard.  
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** → U.S. security guidance.  

---

## Task 4 – Audits & Accountability
- Internal and external audits verify compliance.  
- Non-compliance can result in **fines, reputational damage, or loss of contracts**.  

---

## 📝 Key Terms
- **Policy vs Standard vs Procedure vs Guideline**  
- **HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOX, ISO 27001, NIST CSF**  

---

## 💡 Practice Prompts
- Differentiate **governance** from **compliance**.  
- Give one example of each: **policy, standard, procedure, guideline**.  
- Name two industries where compliance is heavily regulated.
