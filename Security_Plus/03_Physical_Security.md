# 03 — Physical Security

Physical controls, surveillance, and entry protection.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Explain perimeter & entry controls.  
- Identify surveillance methods and common bypasses.  
- Describe anti-tailgating and badge-cloning mitigations.

---

## Task 1 — Perimeter & Barriers
- **Fencing, gates, bollards** — deter vehicle/foot intrusion.  
- **Vehicle barriers** (ram-resistant), lighting, signage.

---

## Task 2 — Surveillance & Sensors
- **Video (CCTV)**, motion sensors, IR, door sensors.  
- Failures: power/cable/tamper, blind spots, poor retention/config.

---

## Task 3 — Access Controls
- **Badge readers (RFID/NFC)**, PINs, biometrics (fingerprint, iris).  
- Anti-tailgating: mantraps, turnstiles, security guards, badge / biometric combo.

---

## Task 4 — Badge Cloning & Mitigations
- Attack: read badge, clone data, reuse.  
- Mitigations: encrypted badges, multifactor (badge + PIN), monitor anomalies, limit privileges by location/time.

---

## Key Terms
- Tailgating, piggybacking, FAR, FRR, access control vestibule, mantrap

---

## Practice Prompts
- Where would you place 3 cameras for max coverage? Explain.  
- List three mitigations for badge cloning.  
- Describe the difference between a mantrap and a turnstile.
