# 03 — Physical Security

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Describe perimeter, surveillance, and entry controls.  
- Identify bypass methods used against physical defenses.  
- Understand badge cloning and biometric systems.  

---

## Task 1 – Perimeter Defenses
- **Fencing** → establishes boundaries, deters intruders.  
- **Bollards/barriers** → prevent vehicle entry.  
- **Guards** → human deterrence and monitoring.  
- **Lighting** → reduces cover for attackers.  

Attackers may try **force entry, tampering, or bypassing guards**.  

---

## Task 2 – Surveillance
- **Cameras**: pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ), night vision, motion detection.  
- **Sensors**: infrared, microwave, vibration, ultrasonic.  
- **Guards** and **alarms** provide active response.  

Bypass tactics: covering cameras, cutting power, or interference.  

---

## Task 3 – Entry Control
- **Access control vestibules** (“mantraps”) → prevent tailgating/piggybacking.  
- **Door locks**: mechanical, keypad, or electronic (RFID, NFC).  
- **Biometric authentication**: fingerprints, retina scans.  
  - **FAR (False Acceptance Rate)** → how often unauthorized users are allowed.  
  - **FRR (False Rejection Rate)** → how often authorized users are denied.  
  - **CER (Crossover Error Rate)** → balance point between FAR and FRR.  

---

## Task 4 – Badge Cloning
- RFID/NFC cards can be scanned and copied.  
- Mitigations: encrypted cards, **multi-factor authentication**, protective sleeves, monitoring unusual access logs.  

---

## 📝 Key Terms
- **Tailgating vs Piggybacking**  
- **RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)**  
- **NFC (Near-Field Communication)**  
- **FAR/FRR/CER**  

---

## 💡 Practice Prompts
- Explain the difference between **tailgating** and **piggybacking**.  
- How can badge cloning be prevented?  
- What’s one advantage and one risk of biometric authentication?
