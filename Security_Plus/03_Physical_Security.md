# 03 – Physical Security

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Identify **physical security controls**: barriers, guards, surveillance.
- Recognize **entry control technologies**.
- Explain **badge cloning** and mitigation strategies.

---

## Perimeter Security
- **Fences** → people deterrent.
- **Bollards/Barriers** → stop vehicles.  
- **Guards** → active response, deterrence.
- Attack vectors: ramming, tampering, bypassing guards.

---

## Surveillance & Monitoring
- **CCTV** (motion, infrared, PTZ).  
- **Lighting** → reduces blind spots.  
- **Sensors**: IR, pressure, ultrasonic, microwave.  
- Attackers may try to **blind, obstruct, or tamper** with these systems.

---

## Controlled Entry
- **Access control vestibules** → prevent tailgating.  
- **Door locks**: traditional, cipher, electronic (RFID/NFC/BLE).  
- **Biometrics**:
  - FAR = False Acceptance Rate
  - FRR = False Rejection Rate
  - CER = Crossover Error Rate

---

## Badge Cloning
Steps: scan → extract → write → use.  
**Defenses**:
- Encrypted badges
- MFA
- Shielded sleeves
- Updated protocols

---

## 📝 Key Terms
Tailgating, Piggybacking, FAR, FRR, CER, RFID/NFC

---

## 🧩 Practice Prompts
- Explain the difference between tailgating and piggybacking.  
- List 3 countermeasures to badge cloning.  
- What is CER, and why is it important?
