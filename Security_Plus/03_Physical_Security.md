# 03 â€” Physical Security

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
- Identify physical barriers and entry controls.  
- Describe surveillance methods and bypass tactics.  
- Explain access controls including biometrics and badge systems.

---

## Task 1 â€“ Perimeter
- **Fences & Gates** â†’ Delay/limit entry.  
- **Bollards** â†’ Stop vehicles.  
- **Guards** â†’ Visible deterrent + responsive defense.

---

## Task 2 â€“ Surveillance
- **Video Cameras** â†’ Coverage, motion sensing, PTZ.  
- **Lighting** â†’ Increases visibility and reduces hiding spots.  
- **Sensors** â†’ Infrared, pressure, microwave, ultrasonic.  
- **Bypass tactics**: obscuring camera views, blinding with lights, cutting power.

---

## Task 3 â€“ Controlled Entry
- **Access Control Vestibule (Mantrap)** â†’ Prevents tailgating.  
- **Locks** â†’ Traditional, cipher, electronic (RFID/NFC/BLE).  
- **Biometrics** â†’ Based on FAR, FRR, CER balance.  
- **Badge Cloning** â†’ RFID/NFC cards can be scanned/copied.

---

## Task 4 â€“ Mitigations
- Use encrypted/protected badges.  
- Apply MFA with card + PIN/biometric.  
- Awareness training for tailgating/piggybacking.

---

## Key Terms
FAR (False Acceptance Rate), FRR (False Rejection Rate), CER (Crossover Error Rate), Tailgating, Piggybacking

---

## Practice Prompts
- Explain how an access control vestibule works.  
- List 2 ways attackers can bypass surveillance.  
- Define **CER** in biometrics.
